Insurance
Good morning. I'm looking for dental work and would also like to explore cosmetic dentistry eventually. I currently have united Concordia for insurance. I noticed on your info sheet that my insurance is "non participating" but "continue to accept." Does that mean I could still become a new patient and use this insurance?
Do you have free or low cost dentistry for low income patients?  My grandson's babysitter is missing her two front teeth and may require other cosmetic work but cannot afford it.  Is there anything you could do for her?  She lives in Royal Oak. Thank you. Elizabeth
I am an adult with Medicaid insurance. I need braces and was wondering what the average price would be. Thank you!
I need to make an appointment for extraction of wisdom tooth and don't know whom to call.
Hi, I had an X-ray done of my whole mouth and my dentist discovered an impacted wisdom tooth of my bottom left side literally laying on its side. I've been getting headaches on the top of my head and was wondering if that could be the problem.  I originally decided not to get it removed because I was told it could cause nerve damage and that I could lose all feeling on that side. What do you recommend?  If I get it done at U of M, would it be possible to have a professional dentist and not a student perform this high risk procedure?  Thank you Jason Rzucidlo 734-812-9146

Hello Michigan Dental School. I got a call from a dental student to make an appointment. My previous student was Carly Warden but has graduated.  On the phone I think the student identified his name as Garrett and couldn't understand the last name. He gave me the phone number of 847-331-9351 (the last number was so fast that I'm not sure it was correct). I called it and the voice message was from a woman. I tried to contact Carly to help but could not get in touch. I also had a student who said he would do work on me. His name is Jared Roberts. I called his number and was not available though it was the correct number. I called information and they could not find Jared Roberts. I also left a message with Stefan Rodriguez at 764-8228. Please help with this. Thank you, David Rigan my phone is 734-663-4901

Hi, I have a question regarding full upper and lower implants.  My wife has had a lost of teeth since getting a tumor and a lot of Cortisone injections.  She is a beautiful woman and with a full again it would be a big difference in her life and mine.  We have our own business so meeting with clients is important which she can do at the moment because of her teeth lose.   We have been getting quotes around for implants and they are very expensive but she cannot wear dentures so her only choice is implants.  Since I am a huge Michigan Wolverine fan I thought I would check to see what the cost is if she was to come down to your school and volunteer to have it done with a guided expert of course.  What is the pricing and is it a possibility?    Thanks Brian Zenker owner www.alltech4u.com
I have seen Dr. Gonzales in the past.  I am currently seeing Dr. Ann Decker. We are contemplating future procedures.  She has told me that having spoken w/Dr.Gonzales that:  "Dr. Gonzalez stated that from a restorative perspective it might be better to bridge that tooth in the front, which if he did it in DFA would be about $6000."   My question is: Is this $6000 the resulting balance after all available insurance coverage is applied ?  I believe that you have the information in my records there regarding my UofM dental insurance coverage if you need it for reference.  If you need any further information from me please feel free to ask.  ( I have tried to make this short and to the point, :-), so as not to waste your time, ... but please know that I very much appreciate your help, :-)! )                                                                                               Thanks, Jane

Please feel free to contact me for further information or questions. Thank you for your swift response to my request. You can either TEXT or EMAIL me. I do not answer phone calls that have caller ID blocked. Again thanking you in advance for your help with this matter.
Can I be a patient with you and if so how do I go about it and what costs if any are associated with getting worked on at your clinics?

Hello, this may seem strange, but I'm looking to have my remaining teeth pulled due to they continue to break and crack. I have had 4 staph infections due to this happening. Now I would normally have then fixed or whatever, but I have a child now and I don't want to risk my life anymore and would just like them pulled and have dentures. If you could let me know if your accepting patients and what types of insurance you take that would be great. And what the rough cost and time frame we would be looking at from pulling to dentures. Thank you for your time.  Brandy Weaver

I'm interested in getting invisiline braces. Who does this and what is the charge? Thank you. MB
I'm Carleys mother. She was seen at the ortho clinic today.  4 brackets had fallen off last time we were seen (sept 12), one right after we left our appointment on sept 12  and the others over the course of a week or two. We called back right away but were unable to be seen for several weeks and the school has closed for The day. and it was not seen as an emergency. She was supposed to have bottoms put on today but this has been delayed now.  Today the brackets were re-glued and when she got home, the same bracket that fell off first last time, did so again. We live 45 mins away and so this is not convenient. I've called and left a message. Please call me or email so we can rectify this. Thank you. Jennifer Bisson 419-279-3647

I was just evaluated by a dentist yesterday for tooth pain, a broken tooth, and a broken crown. The plan was to extract the tooth with the broken crown due to the tooth underneath being broken and the tooth in front and behind need root canals and fillings. Then a bridge.

Not to mention it include sending me to an oral surgeon to have the tooth extracted due to me being on blood thinners. I am in A LOT of pain and don't know what to do.

What is the price for a full set, or partial set for implants. Also, is financing available?
I have dental insurance through Delta Dental and had work done last month on 2 different teeth as far as fillings go. Before the work was done I was told if the procedures don’t work I may need root canals. Everything was fine but now I’m starting to feel issues on both teeth and even another. My plan covers 80% of a root canal after 6 months which I am eligible for since it started in April this year but to my understanding is when you get a root canal you have to follow up with a crown almost 2 weeks later. But for some reason, my plan covers 50% but it’s only after 12 months which would be April 2018. I know crowns are expensive so my question was to see if there’s an alternative for dental work that’s less expensive than my plan offers?
My dentist has told me an implant in not an option due to the fact my bone is to close to nerve.  Is there any innovative procedures for this issue??

I have a friend, Brandee,  who has a broken and infected molar on her lower right side. She had an impacted wisdom tooth along with the molar nearest to it (fourth molar) that was entangled with the wisdom tooth both extracted. The next molar forward (third molar) was already broken and the plan was to do a root canal and cap it. However, since the extraction of the neighboring teeth, she keeps getting infections. At first they thought it was the extraction site, but now they believe it is this broken tooth. They put her on antibiotics and she gets better and once she goes off it comes back. She has gone through three rounds of antibiotics. Her dentist in Jackson gave her an estimate of $280 to extract. What would the fee be for someone at the dental school to extract the tooth? Thank you very much.

Can I come from  Ohio to have  Crown or plants i have Ohio  medicaid insurance but won’t cover These teeth will do a root canal but  they won’t pay for. Crowns
I am in search of a pediatric dentist able to do extensive work on my 4 year olds teeth. She is very cooperative and has had a root canal done in office with just gas. She has been given a treatment plan of 5 more root canals and then also 5 fillings. The waiting is too long for what she needs. Her teeth have gotten substantially worse in a short period and I fear as her mother she will end up losing some teeth if work is not done before the 5 month wait we have been told. Please guide me if this clinic is able to offer anything and if treatment could be done in a reasonable amount of time. Thank you.

My teeth are in really bad shape.  It has been probably 3 years since I’ve been to the dentist and this past year I had ovarian cancer and spent most of the year in chemo.  I am in a lot of pain as I know I have several dental issues, but I am immune to the novacane they use to numb me.  They usually have to give me several shots and then once it does kick in, JT wears off after about 5 minutes if working on me and drilling, so they have to numb me again.  Many times, they’ve just quit because the novacane just wasn’t working.  I hear that you will do sedation dentistry there and I want nothing more than to be out under and have the work done so that I can be out of pain.  I am a white knuckles patient for sure, even though I’m a grown woman, but if the sedation is possible, i will drive from Saginaw to have it done.  So, is it true that you donsedation?  And what can I do to get started?  Thank you so much!

I have no dental insurance.  Do you have a list of your fees?
Hello.  I am a long time patient.  I have been on Medicare since 3/1/17 so pay out of pocket.  Genesee Health Plan in Flint has a new Delta Dental Program Plan #2260 II for Seniors that is free, but it only covers Diagnostic and Preventive and only for providers in Genesee County, so they state I can't use it at UofM.  I would like to remain at UofM and I have some questions for you:    Are my cleanings billed as regular Diagnostic and Preventative or Periodontal done by a specialist?   Would it be possible to have the Diagnostic & Preventive done here in Genesee county but remain a patient with you for everything else?  Everything else according the their plan is Basic Services (Minor restorative Services - filings), Oral Surgery Services (Extractions and Dental Surgery), and Periodontal Maintenance (cleanings by a specialist), and Major Services (Dentures).      Thanks in advance, Diane

Do you take Aetna Vital Dental Savings Plan
I have a bad past. I’m a survivor of domestic abuse. However, the toll it has taken on my teeth has been BAD! I’ve taken care of my top already and have dentures. However, I simply couldn’t afford the bottom to be taken care of at that time. I’m from VA originally and have been here since Nov 2017. I’m just trying to see what I can do to get my bottom taken care of. I need 5 surgically removed. And 6 pulled. And dentures on the bottom hopefully same day!! The 6 are front teeth the broken ones (5) are all back teeth. It would be great to be able to actually chew my food again. I’m 35, and had tons of money in my mouth with orthodontics etc. One bad decision that lasted 10 years has me paying a huge bill just to get some comfort as well as confidence back. If someone could give me a price on what it will cost to have this work done, I’d appreciate it. Thanks and I look forward to hearing from someone soon.

I just have a few questions. I was referred to get my wisdom teeth removed over a year ago, however I didn’t have the money to pay for the specific X-ray they needed. By the time I did, my insurance changed and now I just have straight Medicaid for dental now. The one wisdom tooth I have is growing in my jaw sideways, and the pain is becoming unbareable. Do I need a referral to come here? I live about 2.5 hours away, I can not find a dentist to look at my teeth up here, or at least any good ones. I was told by my previous dentist due to my anxiety and horrible gag reflux they would have to put me asleep in order to extract my teeth and should do them all at once. Will my insurance cover it? I had a place that would do it but only if I had the healthy MI plan. Which I do not. Just mclaren Medicaid and for dental it’s only straight Medicaid.
Hi there, my name is Ye He, a new patient of UM dentistry. And I was wondering what I should do if I want to have an appointment for extraction of my wisdom teeth. I would also like to know the cost of extraction, since I don't have a dental insurance. BTW, do you accept Aetna Vital Dental Savings card?  Thank you, Ye
I am on Medicare and think I will need implants for most if not all top teeth (five on the sides have broken off). I need to have some idea about cost so that I can evaluate the possibility of work. I have limited use of my hands so dentures are not a first choice. Any way to get an idea of what might be involved? (I live in GA so that is a consideration as to how to accomplish the most work to be done at one time. I am 74, have a high pain tolerance, am slender with no medical issues except Rheumatoid arthritis. I also work part time out of necessity.) I am trying to find an excellent dental school with which to work. What can you tell me?

If a patient had a tooth filled by a dental student and had that tooth show up on a dental plan at the next 6 months check-up, is it the financial responsibility of the patient or does the school pick-up the cost?  My mother, Agnes Dunning, (10/27/1928) has been coming for a few years now for her care.  She turns 90 in a few months.  If her teeth are going bad despite U of M dental school efforts, I don't see why we should keep filling them every 6 months.  Please review her chart and make a suggestion for her care.  Thank you, Linda Schofield, her daughter and POA
where do I find medical release forms
I was a patient at the dental clinic in the early 2000s. Is it still possible to get copies of my files? Specifically, my current dentist would like to know information about the implant I got while a patient there. I am no longer in Michigan so any information will need to delivered via email or mail. Thank you!
I would like to be completely sedated for my dental work, do you guys do this?
I’m 26, when I was 18 I lost my insurance and needed my wisdom teeth pulled but I couldn’t afford it so I let them come in. They have sense pushed my teeth to the point they’ve started to shatter. Last year I went to aspen dental for a free consultation and they told me they wanted to pull between 12&15 of my teeth, and told me they couldn’t finance me to have them pulled. I’m in excruciating pain and can hardly eat anymore. In January I broke one of my incisors in half and that’s how I was chewing most of my food. I’m looking to see if you have any programs to help someone in my predicament. I’m to the point I’d let a first year student pull them out just to stop the pain

To Whom It May Concern,  Hello!  I attended two dental appointment with Michigan Dental in March. We did an X-ray examination and my dentist helped me with an examination on my teeth. However, I would be graduating soon so I was afraid that I might not have time for any further treatment. I will be moving to another place this summer. Do you mind me wondering if it would be possible to release a copy of my medical record at Michigan Dental to myself so that I can take it to the new place that I am going to? I was wondering if there would be any consent that I need to sign for this?  Thank you very much!  Have a nice day!  Regards, Ran 4/12/2018

I really don't know where to begin.. U of M is my LAST resort at having any hope of being able to chew or even smile, again - and I truly need some help. I made an appointment with U of M and was there on time (just this past Friday, May 11, 2018. I told the assistant I had already had x-rays not too long ago so I was told I had to sign off on releasing those x-rays to the U of M school of Dentistry, at the dentists' office I had the x-rays done (did that a half hour after I left) Sooo, my concern is that my medicaid will not cover much (or even certain treatments I so desperately need) and I'm left paying out of pocket..my question is how will medicaid/delta dental effect my treatment and do you work with this type of insurance? I'm so grateful/thankful for any help. I look forward to hearing back. Also, if it's easier, my cell number is: 248-946-6697  Respectfully,  Ghada Scafone
Can I pls get an estament on having dentures replaced. Father is going to pay for them but I need a close price pls
I broke off tooth number eight and my dentist advises me to see an oral surgeon to extract the tooth and to do a " socket preservation graft ". I believe my dentist plans on replacing my former tooth with an implant but I believe she said I should not plan on biting off chunks from an apple with the implant as it won't survive that type of stress; she told me I would have to cut apples up and eat them using my molars. Can you direct me to helpful information for alternatives?

Does your facility do consultations and/or second opinions? My dentist told me that one of my teeth can't be saved and that my only option is to have him pull it and have a $3000.00 implant installed. I'm not sure this is absolutely true and would sincerely appreciate having someone take a second look.
I was born in 1965. I have no teeth insurance. I have three loose teeth in recent half year. I think it is because of my gum disease. One of my wisdom tooth was broken and tooth root is in. And I always have toothache. Can I make an appointment to see my teeth by email? I made an checkup clinic appointment yesterday. I was told to call 7347636933.
I received a letter in the mail saying that you were sorry that I was discontinuing treatment at the Dental School. I never asked to discontinue services. Why am I receiving this letter and who authorized it? Who do I need to contact next. I believe that I saw my provider, Jonathan Kim, within the last 6 months for my routine cleaning. Did I miss anything? Thank you.

I have TMJ/TMD. I paid one dentist $10,000 only to make me worse. I went to another dentist who is trained in the OBI (oralganthic bioethics) method. Cost $35,000. At first I felt really great. Gradually I started suffering again only to be told the dentist didn't observe my model correctly and I started breaking all my crowns and destroyed two bridges. My crowns are all porcelain. One of you former alumni, Dr Stumpos, in Albion Michigan made me a bruxing splint which I've quit using because it does more harm than good. He advised he can do nothing more for me and to contact you. I have Anthem BC/BS and Delta Dental insurance. I am wise to the fact that medical insurance considers my condition dental and Dental insurance considers it medical so I must come out of pocket for my treatment. What does a consultation with you cost. My condition is injury related. Thank you very much.
I need to know the cost of installing a crown on my top right side tooth?
Hello, I have a wisdom tooth that started growing 8 years ago. Back then I went through an X-ray scan and was told that I needed surgery. However I have kept postponing the surgery until now, because I can see the tooth has almost fully grown. Now, I am not sure why the pain keeps coming back once in a while, and it is so painful that my head and ear get hurt too. I do not know if I should still get the tooth removed, because it has grown quite clearly. I would like to know how much the x-ray and oral surgery services cost for me if I go to the Student Clinic. I am an international student so I do not think my insurance covers dental care. I cannot afford much so I want to know the fee and see if it fits Munich budget. Thank you.

Hello, I was wondering if you take patients that have no dental insurance? Thank you, Marah Steveson
When is the best time to do impressions for dentures, before tooth extractions or after extractions, when would a person get the best fitted denture? I just had my teeth extracted on May 24th. The dentist put a temp upper denture in and I can not wear it. It doesn't fit properly, it hurts to wear it and leaves sores in my mouth and the bite isn't right, so I'm not wearing it. He also gave me a lower partial which I hate to say is not much better. I'm not feeling very comfortable or confident about the permanent denture I'm to get in November. The impressions wear taken before my extractions. I don't see how the new denture will fit any better than the temp denture. Also I am wondering if the school does dentures after extractions have been done somewhere else?

How do I get on your care list?  I have a root cannel under an existing cap
Hello, I am in search of dental implants. My teeth are so bad and so painful it is ruining my life. My name is Jennifer and I am 40 years old. I am a single mother with 3 kids. I lost my husband to suicide, he shot himself right before my eyes and it left me in a Great Depression where I did not take care of myself. I have now picked myself back up and I am a full time nursing student. My husbands suicide destroyed the lives of me and my children and it was hard to come back from that.  I don’t have much money and I have bad credit. I can not get care credit and I do not have a large down payment for the implants. I can however make a monthly payment and have a debit card on file to automatically take the payment out monthly.  I have searched to no avail for a pro bono dentist. I am not asking for a handout or free implants I am just asking to be able to get the implants and make a monthly payment without a large down payment. My teeth are so bad I would be willing to be used as a before and after for photos or anything else to help. Believe me you would not regret doing that, it’s pretty bad. I would also be willing to work for free doing any tasks necessary in your dental office.  I am in pain every day. I have constant abscess and infections. I have gained weight only being able to eat non healthy foods because my teeth are so painful and so bad. Please help me or refer me to someone who can. I am a struggling single mom just trying to get through nursing school and not be in pain every day of my life, and I would like to be able to smile again. I don’t go out in public unless necessary and I don’t laugh or smile anymore due to embarrassment. Please help me. Again I have bad credit and I can’t afford a large monthly payment so if you require that please don’t have me come in for a consult. I have had many many dentists say they would help me only for me to go in to all of them for a consult then tell me at the end they want a large down payment or that due to my credit they can not help me. It is devastating each and every time.  If you would like photos of my teeth I would be happy to send them. Please please help me.            Thank you, Jennifer You can reach me at 734-775-9099 or Jhunt197821@hotmail.com

I have screws, from jaw surgery years ago, that are coming onto my mouth point first, beside / under my tongue. It’s very painful and inflamed. My left jaw aches and I have a mild fever. I would like someone to clip off the pointed end of the screws.  I only have dental cleaning coverage through BCN Medicare Advantage. I will need to set up a payment plan. I am disabled by back pain, and live on a limited income.   I have been to your clinic in the last few years, for a tooth removal. I was forced to go to your clinic because Community Dental refused to do it, due to worries about my jaw plates, screws, and bone thinning. They said I needed to consult an oral surgeon just for the tooth-pulling. I believe you have my latest scans.  Can you tell me where to start with an evaluation appointment? Not sure if oral surgeon or student clinic.   Thank you for your help.  Lauren Moore 2224 Golfside Rd Apt 102 Ypsilanti, MI 48197 614-312-3232 (please leave message if you call.)

I have 3 children that need  to get into a dentist they haven't been to a dentist in about 3 years.  My husband is a disabled veteran so the kids have CHAMPVA medical insurance but it doesn't cover Dental.
I had Kermit Stanton make a partial for the lower teeth, one tooth on each side. it doesn't fit, I kept going back in, he could not get it to fit. the last time I was in his office, I told him it still did not fit, He took it into the back of his office, gave it back to me and told me I was right, so take it home and put it in a drawer. I received a letter afterwards from him, that he was retiring and selling the business. I want  to get a second opinion. I paid for this partial and have not been able to use it.
I was wondering if there are any dentists that are familar with treatment plans for children with DENTINOGENISES IMPERFECTA.

Hi UofM Dental What dental insurance plans or discount dental plans do you accept? I am looking at purchasing an outside dental discount plan are there any you suggest that are accepted at your dental school? Thank you Godblesschildsown@gmail.com
how are you helping the disabled by setting them up with a payment plan for 10 months and keep having them pay more a month or no dental service if not paid in full by the 10 months...or cant recieve dental help as on the plan...this needs to be changed on how you figure it out...you cant start with a $ for a plan  and than add more thing and expect to be paid in full at 10 months....if someone could  afford to pay $1oo a month ...im sure they would be able to have a dental insurance for that price....most disable people get $ 1200.. a month....try to live on that with no other insurence except for medical...

Is there money to be saved by coming to the school compared to licensed dentists?
I've already been told by a dentist after a visit that I could be a good patient for dentures. But my insurance would only cover $2, 000 of it and I'd be looking at about $3, 000 out of pocket. But with your guyses student clinics I was curious as to how much out-of-pocket it would cost me to go there. I'm looking for uppers and lowers. with maybe a couple of implants in the lower jaw. Thanks a lot I hope to hear from you soon.

I have possible help from my parents for some out of pocket copays, but I don't know what to expect.   Thanks for your help .

My father is in his 50s and has no dental insurance at the time.  He is in desperate need of dental care. I believe that he will need some teeth extracted and possible dentures. It's so upsetting to see my father lose his confidence and his smile.

Thank you so much for your time and I'm looking forward to your response.

Is there a charge for the initial consultation for braces for a 12 year old?
I would appreciate information regarding the protocol for treating periodontal disease.  I am a 65 yr old woman with moderate bone loss. My career has been in dentistry as an assistant, office manager and eventually orthodontics. So I was quite surprised and disconcerted to learn of the perio condition. My home care has always been exceptional and I maintained the dental prophy schedule. Somewhere along the line, I was not informed of what was going on and I didn't have an indication, as there is no gingivitis. I do have many 4 and 5mm pockets at this point and no mobility, thank goodness! The x-rays clearly show the loss.  First, I am curious why, of course? Age related, heredity, menopause, too many dog "kisses"?? Secondly, and most importantly at this point, I have 2 conflicting approaches to treatment. We have relocated a few times in retirement, so the new dentist is the bearer of the bad news and she recommended SRP, followed by 3 month recalls. Also she recommended a DNA sample and testing. I followed through with the sampling, but elected not to proceed with the antibiotic and anti microbial regime that was recommended with the report from the lab. ( Canadian company ). I did have the SRP all 4 quadrants.  Prior to the treatment, I contacted and forwarded my X-rays to a friend dentist in another part of the country, seeking her advice. Her return email and info came after I decided to proceed. She said that she would not have done the SRP on me, but suggested this was somewhat age related and I should continue good home care, add the waterpik and Listerine to my regime. She suggested that perhaps my dentist was looking to make some money, especially on a new patient to the office and that office management companies often recommended increasing prophy/recall/perio work. So, I guess at this point in time  (I have had the SRP), I'd like to know if I should seek another opinion for my future dental needs and I'd  to know what the protocols is regarding these bacterial rinses and frequency of perio prophys. I feel that perhaps I was treated from a business perspective as opposed to a scientific perspective and protocol. I don't, by any means, want to take this lightly, but I do want to be judicious when and where it is appropriate. These is a lengthy correspondence, so I thank you  for your time and any advice that you can offer from afar.

Hi there- I just moved from DC to Michigan full-time and back in DC (in late March of 2018) I was told that I only had four fillings to get. I went to a new dentist in August of 2018 in Michigan who told me that I now had 14 cavities, even though my dental hygiene has gotten better and better throughout the years, and that I have only had one other cavity in my life before this. Are there faculty members available who could give me a second opinion who are covered under Aetna? Thanks!

Is there any way I could volunteer myself to be a patient for dental work in exchange for free dental implants? I had to have multiple surgeries on a club foot that collapsed on me. The surgeries started in 2011. I had 5 surgeries in a year and a half. None of them would heal. I ended up having a below the knee amputation of my right leg on July 12th, 2013. I was on crutches and unable to walk for 4 years straight. I was on heavy narcotic pain medications for a total of 5 years. Those coupled with my inability to walk, made my teeth decay rapidly. I still have most of my bottom teeth. All in my top jaw are gone. I cannot wear dentures. I have a hyper-sensitive gag reflex. Also, I do not want my face collaposing in. I am on social security and I do not have money to pay for implants, but I will be a patient for learning if this could get me the dental implants that I need. Please, if there is any way you can help me, please contact me at this email: smithjr1981@gmail.com.   Thank you for your time            Jeremy Smith
What does it cost to have a tooth removed?
I am seeking to switch providers and, as a UM faculty member, turn to you.  I have been under regular care, due just this month for my next 6 month cleaning and checkup. My one concern regards radiography. I would prefer not to have x-rays at this time. I understand that I might need to sign a consent form indicating that I decline a recommendation (my last x-rays were taken a couple of years ago). Will this be a problem?  Many thanks, Richard Straub, Ph.D.

My wife and I are considering  permanent dentures for her.  She has Chrons disease.  She has dentures now and was seen by Dr Munz ( I think I have the right name at the U of M Dentistry office).  She continually has problems with her gums swelling and causing the dentures to ill fit.  I realize that every case is different, but is there any way you could give a "ballpark"  estimate of what permanent denture cost?  She has had her dentures for several years now.  They continually are painful to use, causing a problem with her nutrition.   Are there any kind of assistance programs?  We both are on Medicare and over 65.

Do you do extractions and dentures all the same day?
do you do invisalign at the school of dentistry?
I am a 40 yo woman and, due to a lifelong fear of the dentist office in addition to a very humiliating experience several years ago, I have neglected to seek dental services during those years. I have severe dental issues: several broken teeth, extensive decay, lost crowns etc.I am very close to becoming an emergency dental patient so I can no longer avoid getting these issues dealt with but I am afraid of how I will be treated, not only due to the embarrassment of the condition of my teeth but also because I only have Medicaid as insurance and a very limited income that supports myself and my two sons.   I have an opportunity to start a new career and, while I am an outgoing, friendly, intelligent person, I have to hide my teeth when I speak and rarely smile because some of the decay is now noticeable by people with whom I interact. The anxiety surrounding this is now affecting my confidence in my ability to start this new career that I am so excited about and desperately need. Would I be eligible to be a patient at the UofM School of Dentistry? I sincerely thank you for your time.

I stayed in my marriage for some time and. tried my best to cover the abuse up because i thought it was the best for my kids but I did wake up and divorce my husband and received help for my addiction and now going on six years sobriety! But now i have one thing holding me back when I look into the mirror and see all my past in my teeth & it haunts me to the point my heart drops to my stomach!

I have multiple teeth that need attention that I have put off for some time. My guess is they will need root canals at this point..what is the estimated costs on these procedures?
My husband is in need of 2 extractions and a bridge replacement. He is 71 years old and is on Plavix and an aspirin daily.  His dentist, Dr. Padesky, has recommended he come to U of M as he would be close to a hospital should there be any kind of a bleeding problem and you have dental specialist's to aid in this process.  His heart doctor has stated he will not take him off of the Plavix and aspirin safely until next May (the stints will be 1 year old then and healed) and it is important that this be done sooner. These two teeth that need to be extracted are very important to the bridge he now has.  Is this something your specialist dentist can do?  Let me know if you need his dentist's phone number so you can confer with him on this matter.  Thanking you in advance.

I emailing to inquire about the cost for a dental implant for tooth #3 at the Student Clinic.
I am in a difficult situation.  I have RA and am being treated by a U of M Dr.  I also have bad gum disease and have had many teeth pulled because of it. I have had a lump that forms on the roof of my mouth near gum line in back of eye tooth And it fills with infection,  I take antibiotics and it goes away.   When I started on RA meds three years ago the infection started to come almost monthly which meant I had to stop meds,  go on antibiotics,  this had been happening for a long time.  I went to a local dentist and they tried to get authorized by my meridian Medicaid to get teeth pulled and fit for dentures. It was denied twice and now they said sorry,  can't help you,  find another dentist.  Well the starting and stopping of RA meds gives me no relief with that disease.  So we have stopped them for now,  but I  do need them.  Also the lump has stayed,  I do not feel pain like I normally do but I really need help figuring this out.  Do you think you guys could.  I am 55, I am a smoker,  I live on other side of State.  I do have to be there to see my RA Dr on October 16th at 1030 am.  If you think you can help would you be able to see me after that appointment. Thank you for your time.

My son is a freshman at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  He has fixed lingual retainers, which were installed by his orthodontist after completing orthodontic treatment.  One of the retainers broke today while he was flossing.   1) Can he see someone to get this fixed? 2) If so, would he need to see an orthodontist or could a dentist do this repair? 3) He is covered under my dental insurance, but is under the age of 18.  Would I need to complete paperwork prior to his visit (via fax or email)?  Thank you.

Hello,  I was interested in obtaining a cash estimate for dental implant treatment, replacing a lower first molar, from either your student clinic or graduate student clinic. The molar was removed 1 month ago.   About how much does this cost, with the understanding that the provided price is an estimate? No insurance would be used, as it is not a covered procedure for me. Can either clinic perform the procedure?   Thank you!  -Elissa
Is there someone who understands the use of Emdogain for the use of bone lost and is ther any dentists in the area who can administer Emdogain.
I am a UM alum and had wisdom teeth extracted at the clinic in 1982 (I think) and was happy with the results. Last Friday, I broke a tooth and I'd like to find out about getting it repaired there. I have Delta Dental insurance and I am being told it would cover perhaps half of the cost. I am also covered by Blue Cross Complete/Healthy Michigan Medicaid and would like to find out if that can help with my portion of the cost at UM. The dentist who saw me on an emergency basis does not accept Medicaid. Please call me at 617-429-1977
What hours are you guys open?
What are the price ranges for braces typically?
Hi. I'm a previous patient that was in the middle of a treatment plan. Because of some extreme financial hardship and other personal reasons, I fell behind on paying my bill and was dismissed as a patient. It took me some time but I finally paid off what I owed. I feel discouraged because I've had really bad luck, especially with my dental situation. Is there any way to make an exception and allow me back, and if not, what can I do? Can I have all of my records and xrays to take elsewhere in the event I am still dismissed? Please let me know. I appreciate your help. My number is 517-499-1856

Does this clinic offer implant services and what are associated costs?
Not necessarily related to patient care, but thought you might be able to get me to someone that could help. I am a nurse practitioner for Livio Health in Minneapolis. We see many patients in their homes and in chemical dependency treatment facilities that need dental care. However, nurse practitioners get ZERO dental training in school. I was wondering who I could talk to to potentially get someone at UofM Dental to come to our facility (even a student) to do a one-hour presentation on acute vs subacute vs chronic dental conditions and how we can treat them in the facility/home until they are out of treatment or can get in to see a dentist. Thanks so much for your help!

Hi!! My son is 10 years old and he has a pediatric dentist in Canton. He was sent to an orthodontist to evaluate him. He needs braces for overcrowding etc. Well we have no coverage for orthodontics . They want $1200 just to start and then of course the expense increases as you move forward. So we are looking for an alternative route. My question is, does the UofM student clinic deal with orthodontics or is there orthodontics available that would be overall cheaper for someone without coverage? They encouraged that we start right away, but we don't have the finances.

Someone told me there was a story on ABC12Weather about free dental care for seniors.  Is this true and what services are available
According to a dentist I've seen I need a full upper denture and a partial lower,( to me, a full lower with using 4 possible teeth as anchors), he also informed me of substantial infection amongst my teeth that would also have to be addressed before procedure. He's looking at  $13,000.00. I'm on social security and I'm looking outside this country for a more affordable situation.      I'm retired, single and have a 720 credit score. Time and travel are not a problem. If we can come to a more affordable situation, I would much rather help an aspiring dental student or more and keep the money in Michigan, than heading out of country. If you feel this might be a workable situation for both of us, please contact me via email or phone. Thank you for your time and trouble .My phone number is 313-383-5855.
Is the University dental department doing growing of new teeth from stem cells?  Is there a program for patients in that area?  If yes, please direct me to links or phone numbers where I can learn more.  If not, can you direct me to any dentists in/near West Michigan that do that type of restoration?  I have a tooth (#19) with a very large filling, with one corner of the tooth now broken off.  If there is any chance of growing a new tooth, rather than putting a crown on it, I would love to check out that option!  Thanks for any information you can send to me.

How much do upper and lowe implants cost? Got a lower partial more than 20 years ago when I was still able to work and could afford going to the dentist.  Needed the partial as my lower front teeth were crooked and decayed due to illness (Cerebral Palsy, Asthma and Migraines and the subsequent meds used to treat them) and one of my permanent teeth had never grown in so my dentist at the time said braces would not help, a partial would be the best option.  Since the placement of the partial I have lost more teeth upper and lower. Chewing in sometimes difficult and painful. I have several broken fillings and an incomplete crown due to not having dental insurance. This has recently resulted in multiple episodes of pain and swelling.  I have resorted to self treating with left over amoxicillin from tne root canal, sensodyne toothpaste and peroxide rinses. My husband just got dental coverage at his job-delta dental.  Don't know if you accept that but if not, do you have payment plans?

Are your services only available to faculty and students? If discounted rates are available to nonfaculty (i.e general public), how can a person make an appointment?
My name is Lillian Grabow. my daughter (Liana Carter) works at U of M and upon talking with her this past weekend about some up coming (Nov. 27, 2018) dental work I will be having done in Alpena, Michigan and the subsequent costs,  my daughter suggested that I contact the U of M Dental school.  She feels that I may have a significant savings if I were to have the needed dental work done at the U of M Dental school. I currently have an upper denture, and am experiencing significant bone loss in my lower jaw which is causing the remainder of my lower teeth to become loose.  Right now my treatment plan is to have the two lower canine teeth extracted and bone grafts placed to grow enough bone to support implants and to receive "flipers" to protect the area. After a 3-4 month healing/growing period I will have the implants placed and "flippers" re-adjusted. After another 3 -4 month period I will then have the remainder of the lower teeth extracted and a snap on/implant supported lower denture put in place. A new upper denture has also been included. Thus far the projected cost to me will be around $15.000.00. If someone could give me a call sometime before Nov. 20, 2018 to discuss this further I would greatly appreciate it. Please note that I live and work on a remote island in the Pacific Ocean and our time difference is 7 hours behind Michigan.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to hearing from you soon. Lillian

Hi, I have a tooth that has a cavity in it and also needs to be re-filled (it was filled back when I was in elementary school) I am now 29.  Earlier this year I had been waiting to get the dental work done but then my insurance ran out before I could get to it, and to make matters worse I then chipped about a 1/4 of the tooth off while eating.  The dentist filed it down for now so it wasn't hurting or jagged anymore but it still needs to be fixed, filled and crowned.  How much would you guys charge for something like this?  It is the second tooth from the back of my mouth on the top right.  How much do you charge just for an appointment to look at it and see what needs to be done?    Thanks.    Kylie
How much on average does it cost while going through the Student Clinic?
I have a patient who is a student at U of M.  He needs a FMX and adult prophy.  I will gladly be responsible for the exam.   How do we go about arranging this?  I think he could be a great hygiene student's patient.  Possibly could meet board requirements.   Please call me at 231-590-0554  or email me at above email.  With gratitude,   Dr. Peter W. Piche',   Class of '95
Hello, The other day I went to dental dreams to enquire about a tooth extraction, as I had broken that tooth. Per the X-ray results, the dentist said that I'll need a surgical extraction. The tooth is mostly gone, and there's an abscess, which he prescribed antibiotics and a painkiller for.  I have Blue Cross Complete insurance through Healthy Michigan, and while I am awaiting a replacememt card, I do have the beneficiary ID.  My question is as follows: I live in Lansing, and your facility is the closest one to me that does oral surgery along with accepting my insurance. Do you accept patients from Lansing or woildI have to be in or closer to the Ann Arbor area?

Is a dental consultation (I'm concerned about my wisdom tooth) included in my tuition (undergrad)?
So I'm looking to get two implants as well as four crowns. As well as replacing silver fillings with white fillings.  I've been to a dental school in Wyoming and very much enjoyed the experience and enjoyed helping out the students . Since I'm a 24 year old adult with baby teeth and most of my adult teeth never existed they found it interesting . I was wondering what kind of insurance you take as well as payments and if its possible to make an appointment sometime in January to start a process of working on my teeth asap. I'm may be getting married in the autumn of 2019 and would love to have a great finished smile before then .
Are individuals without insurance able to receive treatment? If so, are they required to pay in full or by payment plan?
I am trying to cancel an appointment but can’t get thru what should I do?
What is the cost of extractions
I have ground my teeth down to the soft part of my front teeth . I’m also tongue tied and have sleep apnea , would I be a good candidate for your clinical program? I’ve been told I need the tongue clipped, therapy, braces and then restoration.  I’m 65 years young.
Are patients seen by students or DDS at this clinic? Can I request a particular dentist? I am a UMHS Staff member on the Delta Dental plan and would like to become a new patient in Dr. Aronovich's clinic, if possible. I can't seem to find information on how to enroll as a new patient or how to transfer documents from my previous dentist. Is there a webpage you could direct me to? Thank you!
Hi I have an appointment this coming week but I'm not sure as to want day or time it is. Can you please let me know when it is? Thank you!

Hello, I am wondering if you accept united healthcare Medicaid? And what are your average cost of traditional braces? I am in serious need of braces and a friend told me your clinic might be able to help.
Hi there!  Over a decade ago, I had orthodontic care done at Dr. Tim's practice in Saline, Michigan. While the work that was done was fantastic, since then I wasn't always able to wear my retainer and my teeth are shifting back. This is very painful, as my teeth are cutting into my tongue. I don't want to file down my teeth, but do want to permanently re-align them. My teeth are a unique case in that I still have my baby teeth for four of my front lower mandible teeth. Would it be possible to get in for an assessment ASAP? I need a price quote before the 30th of December, so that I can budget appropriately for the upcoming year.   Thank you for your time and consideration.
I have a nephew who would like to have some teeth extracted and get dentures, but can't afford to go to the dentist and someone had told him to check with the dental schools and he can get it done cheaper. Do you have a program where students work on patients and if not do you know of a school that does? Thank you, Patty.
how much for a complete set of dentures
Hello. I am scheduled for an appointment with oral surgery next Monday after coming into the clinic as a new patient with severe tooth/jaw pain along with broken/missing teeth. My question is that what is the usual oral surgery procedure entail? I know the woman who scheduled me said I will be having some type of procedure done that day. I know every case is different, but just knowing more details such as the type of anesthesia used and double checking that they know I have a rare autoimmune disease that makes my case complex will help a great deal in easing the anxiety I have about Monday. Any information you can provide will be greatly appreciated. I didn't find much information on your website and I guess I assumed more paperwork would of been given to me today in preparation for my appointment. Sorry for the questions. To say I am nervous and scared is an understatement.
I’m hoping you can help me.  My 14 year old son had braces put on two years ago, we have fallen on hard times and can’t make the payments, it’s either pay for the braces to come off or keep a place to live. My son is in pain, the place that put his braces on refuse to see him unless I give them $920.20.  Like I said we have fallen on hard times and are having troubles paying our bills, we don’t have extra money left over. My husband is paid biweekly which makes being low on bills even harder.  I just want my son to be happy again.  We clip broken wires so they won’t stab his mouth and it’s not working anymore.  We are at a complete loss.  The wax is doing nothing for him at this point.  Please help me figure something out.
Do you perform basic cleaning as well as crowns/cosmetic dentistry ?
My question is do you accept Delta Dental insurance? I was looking to get braces for an underbite. My dentist says it’s an easy fix. I just want to know the steps in getting braces here?
do you accept cosmetic dentistry grants?? i was awarded said grant but they do not have their dentists here, but in new york. they said i may find a cosmetic dentist of my choosing who will accept the grant and i will be able to proceed.
Hello, I have an appointment with Khaled Sinjab on 1/22/19at 9 am. I know when I was in for my cleaning I am in need of 2 fillings at least. We were waiting til the new year for my insurance to start over.  Justin is who I usually see. I am not sure though how to set up an appointment to get the fillings done. If I could schedule it for the same day that I will already be there that would be great! If someone could call me at 810-444-8613  Thank you and have a Merry Christmas! Christa

I need a tooth pulled but i have no insurance how much would it cost
Hi there, I've been wanting to inquire about how to find out how getting work done through the school works but had no idea how to ask so I may not be able to make sense to you, however , I hope I come close enough! I'm in need of a lot of dental work. I have been consistently getting work done but I can't ever get caught up!  Of course with dental insurance only covering $1,000 a year, it certainly doesn't help. My dentist office quit accepting payments a few years ago so I got care credit which I have a limit on and the interest is extremely high if not paid off by certain period so I only get a limited amount of work done at a time. I can't tell you exactly everything I need done right now but some I know of are as follows: I have at least 3 broken teeth, I do have an appointment for January 15 for a root canal, I need many more crowns (I already have at least 6, I've lost count), my dentist tells me that eventually all four of my top front teeth will need to be crowns, I had a tooth pulled recently (which I regret) due to lack of insurance, I know I have cavities that need to be filled also. I guess what I'm getting to is, is there financing available and the possibility of getting everything "done" in a short time? This has caused me nightmares and major depression, I just want to have a "normal" mouth, as normal as can be that is. I do not have much enamel left on my teeth. Almost every family member has dentures...that is something I'm trying to avoid! Thank you for your time!
I am trying to reach the dental office. If this is the wrong place I apologize.  Hello, I am in a desperate need of help and in search of dental implants. My teeth are so bad and so painful it is ruining my life. My name is Jennifer and I am 40 years old. I am a single mother with 3 kids and a full time nursing student. I lost my husband to suicide, he shot himself right before my eyes and it left me in a Great Depression where I did not take care of myself. I have now picked myself back up and I am a full time nursing student. My husbands suicide destroyed the lives of me and my children and it was hard to come back from that. My health is at stake because my teeth are so bad I am terrified of getting an infection and dying from it leaving my kids behind without any parents at all.  I don’t have much money and I have bad credit. I can not get care credit and I do not have a large down payment for the implants. I can however make a monthly payment and have a debit card on file to automatically take the payment out monthly.  I have searched to no avail for a pro bono dentist. I am not asking for a handout or free implants I am just asking to be able to get the implants and make a monthly payment without a large down payment. My teeth are so bad I would be willing to be used as a before and after for photos or anything else to help. Believe me you would not regret doing that, it’s pretty bad. I would also be willing to work for free doing any tasks necessary in your dental office.  I am in pain every day. I have constant abscess and infections. I have gained weight only being able to eat non healthy foods because my teeth are so painful and so bad. Please help me or refer me to someone who can. I am a struggling single mom just trying to get through nursing school and not be in pain every day of my life, and I would like to be able to smile again. I don’t go out in public unless necessary and I don’t laugh or smile anymore due to embarrassment. I am almost finished with nursing school and I am embarrassed to work in the health industry saving people when I can not even save myself. Please help me. Maybe if you could speak with the dentist directly and let the dentist read my letter maybe they could help. Again I have bad credit and I can’t afford a large monthly payment so if you require that please don’t have me come in for a consult as I live quite far. I have had many many dentists say they would help me only for me to go in to all of them for a consult then tell me at the end they want a large down payment or that due to my credit they can not help me. It is devastating each and every time.  If you would like photos of my teeth I would be happy to send them. Please please help me.            Thank you, Jennifer You can reach me at 734-775-9099 or email at jhunt197821@hotmail.com

I have Delta Dental Insurance, and they will allow the Dentist to bill them $997.00 for each crown replacement. My out of pocket cost will be $500.00 per crown. I am retired, and cannot afford to pay $1,500.00 for the 3 crowns.

I’m fairly young early 20’s and will probably have to get dentures soon due to vitamin D deficiency that has damaged my teeth. My question, are you able to put braces on dentures? Not for orthodontic purposes and I’m sure I will have to pay for the braces myself but just so my dentures don’t quite appear to be dentures.
I have a clear fluid filled sac on the inside of my lower lip. It looks like it could be a mucocele cyst based on what I’ve been reading online. I have seen mixed reviews about what I can do about it. Some people say to drain it, some say don’t touch it. It’s really annoying though. What can I do, or should I go in and have a dentist do something?
Is there any type of discount/lower price arrangements made for currently-enrolled university students, who are not in the dental program?
I was told by a local dentist that some schools do work for free or a very low cost. I have very poor dental health and can't afford the proper treatment. I was curious if you allow people to volunteer for students to work on their dental issues. It's a big health concern for me and I'm completely out of other options. If you don't allow this any other advice you could give would be appreciated.

I recently acquired dental insurance, I haven’t had any dental care in a very long time and I went to a dentist and she basically said she didn’t think she could do anything for me due to the severity of decay I have. She suggested that I try the dental schools in my area. My question is do you work on people that have severe dental decay? I have a lot that needs to be fixed, basically everytooth has some sort of decay and I have three broken wisdom teeth, two that are broke down to the gum. A molar that has a huge hole in it and a front tooth that is cracked down the middle, and those are just the visuals issues from my understanding.Do you guys take patients that have a lot that’s going on. It was very heart breaking to hear that I may not be able to fix my teeth, now that I have the means too, but she made it out to sound like too little too late. I’ll be looking forward to your response, thank you.

Joann,  Please cancel our appointments for Monday January 21. We wanted an answer to our question regarding pre determination of services before we proceeded.

Fees for a no insurance molar extraction?
Hello. I am the mother of a special needs daughter who needs dental care. Her last appointment was in April 2015 at Cambridge Dental Group where she had significant dental work done under IV sedation. Since that time the nurse anesthetist and her dentist has left the practice. No other practice since then has met her needs for IV sedation as oral meds ceased working when she was 8 or 9 and so the local pediatric dentist referred us to Cambridge. My current concern is that I noticed on the referral form that current x-rays are required. Will there be a way to have my daughter seen at your clinic without recent dental info available? My daughter has a cognitive impairment as well as an anxiety disorder so she will not be cooperative to go in now.
Do you offer Dental Implants?
I had an appointment on January 14, 2019 with Zaibak and I haven’t received a call back regarding the discomfort I am experiencing. Also, a treatment plan regarding 8 and 9. To my understanding Dr. Zaibak was to follow-up with one of the doctors at Graduate school. Call someone please call me regarding my treatment plan. My appointment was scheduled out to February 4, 2019 and my root canal procedure was not completed, I believe on January 14, 2019. To my understanding the reception stated she texted Dr.Zaibak. A call back would be greatly appreciated for clarification on this issue. Thanks

I have a question. My mother is looking to have her teeth pulled and have a complete set of dentures made. A gentleman that I work with said your school might be able to perform this.

If you could please email me back at caseycoleman1989@gmail.com or you can call me at 989 891 7030. Thank you

I have a 16 ye old who will be a 100 % qualified recipient of the Kalamazoo promise. He is at the top of his class with a 4 + gpa given those fact I believe if he chooses he could attend school their. My question as it relates to orthodontics is that he desperately needs some orthodontic work. If we could get him started how would we go about that other than just calling and scheduling an assessment. Is there more that needs to be done. From a financial perspective  how Are rates determined?  Are they fixed or are they based on family income , etc... If he did choose to go to school their does that affect pricing for him as well. Thank you for your time and information

Hello, I am wondering if any of your orthodontic practitioners use a technique known as MSE (Maxillary Skeletal Expansion) adult palate expansion, invented by Dr. Won Moon. Thanks!
I had a tooth extracted. During the process a crown on another tooth was knocked off.  The leading doctor told the student that if he had gone" in a direction it could have been avoided." I was charged approximately $40.00 to cement the crown back on the tooth.      I have called the dental office a number of times to speak with someone regarding the charge and have been unable to talk with anyone.     I cannot afford $40 and  I am surprised that the university is not teaching "responsibility " in the program.   Please give me information on who to contact to solve this issue.

I am a 69 yr old woman in good health.  My dentist referred me to a periodontist because of an 8 or 9 mm pocket in my #12 tooth.   After scaling my teeth he recommended the extraction of #12.  My other teeth are in good condition except for the pocket in #12.  I do brush and floss twice daily.  There is some movement of the tooth however, they tested the root and said it is still living.   Are there any other options available to heal this pocket or is extraction the only answer.  I live near by and would be willing to come to your office.   Thank you for your help.

I moved to MI from VA recently and I have an upper denture with implants and I need the denture replaced, implants are fine, I also have a metal bar that the denture snaps into.  The dentist that I am currently going to since October, 2018 has still not figured out how to do the work.  Lots of months of pain and still no upper denture.  I contacted the Dentist in VA that did the work and he suggested that I contact you to see if someone at the school might know how to do this procedure  He also teaches at the dental school in Virginia. If you do not do this at the school might you be able to list some dentists that might so I can finally get a new denture and maybe have no more pain?  I would appreciate any help that you can give me.  I live in Grand Blanc but I am willing drive wherever I need too! Home telephone# 810-344-7751  Cell# 804-370-3246  Nancy Bitely

I am curious to find out the best options to start fixing a tooth that I chipped while falling down a staircase this past summer. Over time my tooth has started to chip away and at this point it causes pain and uncomfortably. It is a tooth located next to my top left canine. I know I will most likely need a post along with a crown. I can explain in better detail over the phone if possible at 616-916-8673. I don't have any health insurance unfortunately and that is my biggest downfall with this situation and I was also denied for Care-Credit and am running out of options and truly wouldn't mind some person to person advice.    Thank you for your time. -Chris Johnson

Are you doing any trials with the Tideglusib sponge technique?
General question about expectations of care for a current patient. She is on Medicaid, and all payments through medicaid have been approved. Her treatment plan has been in place since mid-February. She has to have all her teeth removed (it is a complicated removal because of the excessive decay), and then must be fitted for dentures. My concern is that this process is taking so long. It has been over 2 months since the removals started, yet it is not complete - and the next appointment is not till May. She has now been advised that the whole process could take a year. I have witnessed the extreme pain the patient is suffering, and the delays in completing the removals are just extending the suffering, and she cannot get her life back in order until she has teeth again. Is there anything that can be done to bring this treatment to completion sooner? Thank-you for your consideration from a very concerned future mother in-law.

He shows that he cares about his patients needs.   I could see Evan demands perfection with his work.

He certainly goes above and beyond. Thank you kindly, Patricia Sokolowski

Dear Dental School,  How do I open an investigation on the care that I received at your clinic? I have 2 concerns, the transfer of my medical records and my diagnosis. 1 1/2 years ago, according to Dr. Bloomfield (https://www.google.com/search?q=dr+bloomfield&oq=dr+bloomfield&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j69i59j0l3.4371j0j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), I needed a new a new crown and I had 4 cavities. When I was seen at your clinic, I had 1 cavity. As I was very sick in December, my hematologist was hoping that it was tooth decay. So, how did my teeth repair themselves, or what was missed?   Please advise,  Barbara

I need an upper denture and thinking I need implants to hold them in  apox price  mini where they snap in
I have been trying for a good portion of my life to get dental implants on both my upper and lower jaws, but unfortunately could never afford them. I already know ahead of time that I need a bone graft on my upper right jaw.   I wear a full (ill fitting) denture on my upper jaw, and a partial (4+ missing teeth) on my lower jaw. I have never been happy with my teeth throughout my life.   I was wondering, by any chance, if you are at this point in time, looking for candidates for free, or at a very reduced priced, or a payment plan for lower income individuals to use as real dental implant patients?   I am from the Toledo, Ohio area. I inquired about this over two years ago, and was told that at that time, you weren't looking for new patients.   I am truly hoping and praying that you are looking for dental implant patients at this time.  Please let me know by phone or email if you need someone like me to have your students learn
I am so sorry... I accidentally hit send on my previous email to you, and I did not include my phone number which is 419-283-4800.   This email, and the previous one, is in regards to dental implant surgery. Please let me know at your earliest convenience if you think I would be a good candidate for your students.   I can have my information easily sent to you by my general dentist upon request.  Thank you for your time in reading this, and your decision on whether or not you could use me.

I am 61 and in general good health. I have a canine tooth that's still a baby tooth (I don't believe it's had any work done on it). I recently have had a couple small pieces break off the back. It doesn't hurt. I saw my dentist yesterday and he believes the best options are either a bridge or an implant.  From the info he's given, I believe I would prefer an implant.  My dentist's office can do it but, even with insurance (Delta Dental - thru GM), the out of pocket cost is very high. I've had family members who've had good experiences with the dental school there.  1. Can you tell me which clinic there would be the best to for this issue?  2. About how long would it take to get an appointment (I'm concerned that more could break off and cause a problem)? 3. Can you give me a ball park figure of the total cost & out of pocket cost?  Thank you very much for your time and help.

Hi, I just started a new job 3 months ago as an IT contractor and am currently waiting to become a full employee which includes medical/dental insurance, that happens at the end of the month but I don't know if I should wait. I have a back molar that's infected, it's a tooth that had a previous root canal about 1 year ago or so. I went to urgent care on 6/2 after dealing with progressively worse pain all weekend and received a week's worth of antibiotics in the mean time which has helped immensely, but I'm wondering about having a procedure done to fix this tooth. Is it possible to be given an estimate about what kind of costs I could expect, without insurance, to have this done at University of Michigan? Or is it even possible? I am just trying to weigh my best options here. Thank you so much for your time.

I had damage done to three of my teeth back in November 2018. I was trying to get seen at the school but was unfortunately jerked back and forth and have been living with the pain in my teeth. I have been trying to coordinate with a billing person and patient director since I now have to go somewhere else to have my teeth that were damaged by an advisor there repaired somewhere else and incurring more cost that should not have come about. I was trying to figure out where to send those bills to at the school. But I have my first appointment this Monday and then will have to go from there. So I will be sending either bills that need to be covered or bills for which I need to be reimbursed for. Please respond as soon as possible so the right person can have those sent to the .  Thank you

How much is it to get braces at a student clinic?
I was treated by a graduate student  in 2017. The treatment were  fillings and they turned out to be  completely failures. Right after the fillings,  the teeth suffered extreme pains. This is actually abnormal but I was told to take pain killers only and neglected it afterwards. Then started from this year, the pain resumed  and I had to revisit the dental school . After exam by faculty, I was told  that I have to do the filling again and the failure could have been avoided  if the fillings were done correctly.  At this point, I  lost all my confidence to the treatment done by graduate students.  Could I request the re-filling by a faculty member by the same cost?   I think the dental school share the responsibility in this issue.
I am having dental pain. I've been to a dentist that said I need to have 5 total teeth extracted. The 3 that are causing me pain need to be extracted first.

Thank you.

Hello. I was wondering what kind of advice to give my poor cousin in Michigan, City Indiana. Would this be a good place to bring him considering his situation?  :( I told him I would try to brainstorm some ideas for him, but he said he has already explored all his options. 3000 dollars or sit with infection. That just doesn't seem right. Here is his story:  "I have a front tooth that was operated on when I was 11 that is now rotting out of my face after a root canal and two surgeries and it's perpetually infected.  I can't get a dentist to operate or even evaluate it because I'm uninsured lol.  It's pretty scary and today it's really painful.  When I was 11 I was on Indiana Medicaid.  They wouldn't cover the proper procedure so I got a root canal in a tooth that actually needed to be pulled and the government insurance wouldn't cover it.  My mom couldn't pay the dentist for her own work so when I went in to the same dentist he operated on me when no operation was necessary to get paid by Medicaid and it was pure malpractice but my family didn't help me one bit and I now have a chronic abscess in my mouth. My left nostril has been plugged solid since 2001.  I haven't had health insurance and my teeth are all screwed up and infected all the time which makes me sick and scares me on top of everything else.  I haven't taken a drink of anything or chewed anything in over 20 years without my mouth filling up with infection and blood."

Do you do snap on denture's?
I went to the free mouth guard clinic yesterday at my Grad Dentistry Dr Jennifer Beaz-Polan's recommendation due to my severe teeth grinding problem. I got my mouth guard which fit perfectly initially w/o any issue. However, when I tried to wear it again last night the mouth guard changed to a very stiff material and shrink significantly from the initial dimensions. It no longer fit. I then trimmed the upper outer edge of the mouth guard to make it fit but the material is still very stiff. I wondered what has changed, is this normal for a mouth guard? Any other patients give you similar feedback? Anyway I got my mouth guard to fit now except it is stiff. I have had great experience with UM Grad Dentistry and Dr. Beaz-Polan is great,  one of the best dentists I have worked with ! I would like to leave this feedback to the teams so they would learn what I experienced, not as a negative feedback.  Thanks for your attention.  best,  Chi Li

School of Dentistry University of Michigan 1011 N. University Ann Arbor, MI 48109  Patient: James (Steve) Thrall #776344  August 9, 2019  ATTN: Ann Sompi and Maury Debber  Thank you for your past dental care. I have enjoyed the school’s benefits for quite a few years and have had very good relationships with the students handling my visits. I’ve enjoyed watching them move on from Ann Arbor to Toronto to Texas as they start their careers.  As my records show, I come from Grand Rapids for my visits and in the past that was convenient—due to the fact that I had business in Ann Arbor on a regular basis. Now I am retiring and have no reason to travel to Ann Arbor any longer.   I need to request that my records be transferred, but I do not have a new dentist in Grand Rapids, yet. Do you know of any recent grads who have found positions here in Grand Rapids?  What else do I need to do to get my transcripts sent? Can they just come to me? X-rays and all? Not sure how that works, but please advise.    J. Stephen Thrall 34 Baynton NE  Grand Rapids, MI 49503  616-826-0990

I recently had a root canal (not from you but rather a local Ann Arbor periodontist that my dentist suggested) and now they said I should get a crown.  It currently had a temporary filling.  I just got the estimate and my insurance will not cover it and as a student it is way too expensive for me to cover it.  Is it possible to get this done through the dental school?  I am a PhD. student in SPH.
I am inquiring as to if you offer free services (cleanings) to senior citizens?

Dear Dental School,  I filed a complaint about my appointment back in February, and I haven’t heard anything. As I work at NCRC and I don’t have a telephone, please email me at bstanny@umich.edu to arrange counsel.  My complaint(s):  • $100 charge for x-rays I was told that I checked a box stating that I didn’t have x-rays, but that document has not been shared with me. For the life of me, I don’t recall that box, could you email the document to me (bstanny@umich.edu)? As I didn’t do e-check-in, I’m guessing that the check box was on the paper that I filled out at the time of my appointment. If that was the case, when people encounter that check box, do they then leave to go get their x-rays? As x-rays take time to transfer, do people get charged for the then cancelled appointment? And, shouldn’t the transfer of x-rays be requested at the time of the appointment as other Michigan Medicine clinics do? In December (2018), I had 4 CT scans, and 2 chest x-rays. In January (2019) I had a mammogram. I’ve had so much radiation that my hematologist ordered an MRI. Why in the world, if I had the option to transfer my x-rays, would I willing want more radiation?  • Warfarin on my intake document I stated that I was on Warfarin, but it was never mentioned in the clinic. Please tell me, how can you pick and chose what you want to read on that document.  • Excessive radiation due to clinic mistakes The person taking my x-rays had never done in the United States, and need to redo 2 of them.  • X-Ray transfer within the clinic How is it, that some of your doctors in clinic, ask the patient for their transferred x-rays, and others don’t? I wasn’t asked. I know nothing about transferring records, nor insurance. After talking to someone named Lisa in your office, who knows everything about insurance and transferring records, I regret that she didn’t schedule my appointment as she would have told me this before, rather than after.  • Dental mis-diagnosis At my February visit, I was diagnosis with 2 cavities. However, now 2 years ago, I was diagnosed with 4 cavities and a crown. When I filed my initial complaint, I was told my the dentist that x-rays are subjective. I can’t help but feel if I had been told ahead of time how to transfer my x-rays, you guys would of seen my 4 cavities and a crown. All I got was a hard sell for a fluoride treatment.   Back in the ‘70’s, the U of M Dental School was a godsend to my widowed mom. In the 80’s you did my braces. In the 90’s I got a call from the dentist who did my braces asking if he could use my case in class in Colorado. Now, in 2019, (6 months after appointment) my name and reputation have been maligned, I still have 4 cavities and a crown that need attention and I didn’t even get my teeth cleaned!

I am 70 years and have MANY dental issues. Bordering from bad to worst. Currently, worst. I have a broken, badly decayed left lower wisdom tooth which supports/holds/anchors a six tooth partial (3 teeth on either side.) The crack is a vertical crack and hits below the gum line. From lay "research"  i understand a vertical split/crack (from top to bottom) may be saved even if reaching gum line. The broken part of the tooth may be removed and a root canal along with bonding, or a crown may be constructed to preserve the tooth; it is my hope and a deep desire it's possible. What say you? I also must share: my income is not substantial in any shape, form, or fashion. I do however, have reasonably good credit and I may also make payments of 250$ per month at least  beginning October 3rd 2019. After which payments may be at least 400$ monthy... I begin work as substitue teacher next month. Well. That's all I've got. Sure hope a dentist in your office and a miracle can help me. Thank you.

Does the Domestic Student Health Insurance Plan cover the bill for orthodontic treatments?
hello I am a international student at umich. And I have a teeth brace done in my home country. But some part of my teeth brace fell from my teeth and I need to stick it back to my teeth. Can you help me with where and how should I go to? Thank you.
I unfortunately do not have insurance of any kind. I was wondering the cost of a full extraction with Dentures or implants. I'm only 27 and can not eat most kinds of food anymore because all my molars are missing chunks and over the last year 3 of my front teeth have broken off, the first one on a piece of gum, the second because I accidentally snapped it off with my lower tooth and the third one eating corn on the cob. I'm scared to try and eat almost anything anymore. Friends and family say I don't smile anymore even when I'm happy I keep my lips closed all the time. When I was 18 I didn't have the money to have my wisdom teeth removed, with the lack of proper care for my teeth instead of them making my teeth crooked they just stared braking and snapping. Sorry for the run on, I was just wondering what the cost would be and if there are any grants I could apply for. Thank you

I contacted my dental student, Nisha Patel, today (September 5, 2019)  regarding pain in my left lower side of my mouth related to a possible abscess.  I am having a lot of discomfort and requested to be seen as soon as possible.  I requested a new prescription for Chlorhexidine oral rinse.  She called me later in the afternoon and said that they had placed the order with the Walgreen's in Sturgis, Mich. as I requested.  When I went to the drug store this evening they said the order had NOT been received.  I REALLY need this medicated rinse to alleviate the pain & swelling around the affect tooth.  PLEASE contact this student to make sure she has properly sent the prescription order to the Walgreens located at 950 South Centreville Road in Sturgis, Michigan.  Telephone number is:  269-651-9519.   Thankyou for your consideration in this matter.  Nancy Nishon  269-503-7232

I am seeking information: I am going against the tide in my determination to reverse a traumatized pulp/nerves and allow my tooth to heal.  Refusing (at this time) a root canal and/or possible extraction, I am seeking any study/information/trial that UMich is involved with (or knows about) that addresses a protocol (sedative filling, pulp cap, new materials, etc.) that can be utilized to aid a tooth to recover its vitality. At present, there appears a crack beside a large filling on a rear upper molar and dentists are assuming the fracture is leaking into the pulp, though no one has opened up the tooth yet. I am self-treating with cloves; which have tempered almost all of the  symptoms. I've been told the tooth is already necrotic.  What type of filling can be done at this point; is there a type of method to remove the old filling that won't further distress the pulp?  THANK YOU for any information you can direct me to.

I’m actually looking for Dearborn information about clinics.
Both my husband and I need a lot of dental work.  Mine is basically getting the rest of my teeth pulled and getting dentures.  My husband, on the other hand, has had 2 estimates and it comes to about $10,000 before insurance...we're thinking maybe he should just get dentures, too.  I'm wondering if, once we get a dental plan/estimate can payment arrangements be made.  If so, would it be one payment plan combined or one for each of us?

I've just been told I need to get a root canal. The 4th tooth from the back on the top right of my mouth has a dying nerve and it looks like an abscess is starting to form at the root (which I can feel when I press next to my nostril; it doesn't hurt, it's just a pressure/discomfort). I'm curious to know what the various price points would be to have a root canal done AND a crown. Additionally, would I need to schedule an appointment to be seen before starting the procedure? Thank you!

Do you take medicaid?  Do you accept patience age 3?  My son needs a cavity filled inbetween his front two teeth.  The dentist near me wanted to give him Versed to put him in a conscious sedation and I am not comfortable with that.  Also they did not have anyone with anesthesiology training in the office to monitor his O2 saturation levels and blood pressure.  This is his first cavity and I am anxious about him being sedated.  I'd rather just Nitrites gas and numbing in the location.  What is your procedure for sedating young children.  Thank you

hi...on 10/18/2019 i went to & received treatment ( a cleaning) from your dental clinic...i requested & received nitrous gas & was told that I'd have to pay out-of-pocket for that, so i did (about $102 as i recall)....anyway, it has come to my attention & it is my understanding (though i'm not certain), that medicare or medicaid (i have both) now covers use of nitrous for autistic patients (i have the autism diagnosis since age 4).....therefore, could i please ask you to submit the claim for the nitrous & reimburse me if & when you verify that this is true?....thanks in advance...Ryan Levinstein

I would like to know the costs of a root canal. The tooth is on the top right, fourth tooth from front. I also have an immune deficient child that was misdiagnosed and considered u diagnosed until further gentic testing. She needs to see a dentist and she is special needs as well. She will not tolerate anything in her mouth and won't open her mouth for anyone except myself but only for a short few seconds. She is non verbal as well and has a high pain tolerance. Does not understand when something is wrong and doesn't show normal signs or hints until it becomes a visual thing or from a doctor's visit. She is sedated for MRI's to monitor her hydrocephalus (no shunt) because of immune deficiency. We do know when does not fight off staph, yeast and other mycobacterium on her own. She has a red cheek but it often becomes warm to the touch. It comes and goes and if it comes on, Motrin seems to work. But pediatrician seems to be on the same page as myself for getting checked out. Can we coordinate her sedation for her MRI in December for a dental appt to see if anything is wrong and can be done under 1 sedation since MRI is usually only an hour or o before I see her in recovery?

Hello,   I am an Italian citizen on the Visa Waiver Program currently visiting my fiancée, who is a PhD student at UM. Over the past couple of weeks, I have been experiencing a tooth pain, which I recognized to be due to a wisdom tooth coming out. As a result, it looks like I have been involuntarily biting the side of my mouth in proximity to the tooth, which has now caused a pain that has become unbearable. I purchased some medical insurance package before I came here last month, as I knew I would have stayed over for quite a while, although I am not entirely sure about how it works. I was wondering if I could book an appointment for this, and how much it would cost roughly.   Many thanks.  Kind regards,  Beatrice
I had work done at the clinic. After a year/two years of visiting (student endodontist?) clinic for infected root canal turned cyst, cyst was removed.

No one has called me back to update me

I have always paid my bills, literally hundreds of them. Sincerely, David Rigan.

Because I'm already a patient at the U of M, I wanted to check with you guys first regarding a very urgent issue pertaining to my dental health & well being. I attempted to utilize my Medicaid services at a Hamilton clinic here in Genesee County only to be put in more pain & turmoil. They attempted to extract a molar on my lower right side, couldn't get it out, but made it worse with the attempt. Already been dealing with headaches & now I can't eat at all and am in excruciating pain. I'm currently using my liquid ibuprofen to help with the swelling, but have no antibiotic (yet), or pain meds. I really would just like this removed ASAP or at least receive proper care, exam, & treatment plan. Is this something I can come to Ann Arbor for? Will my blue/green Michigan Medicaid card cover any of this? Do you guys offer IV sedation for oral surgery? Would this be covered? If not, what are these fees? I have a 4 year old that I would love to enjoy Christmas with and not be in so much pain.

I have talked to my student and to the billing office since then and both said that the normal procedure is not to pay the bill until the work is finished which will occur in January. My student is Alex Krupiak. I did  not understand the name of the woman who called me. I should add that I have been a regular patient at the dental school since 1973 and before and that has been the normal practice; I have paid every bill -- hundreds of them over the years and just want to make sure all is good without having to spend more time after talking to so many people. Sincerely, David Rigan

Can you give an approximation of costs for both upper and lower implants?  I've recently had a 3D xray and my bone density is good.  I do however, have a tooth that has busted in half.  I believe its one that's had a root canal, because the only bad pain I get is when the hole is impacted with  food particles I can't brush/floss out.  I believe it is become accessed.  My local MD did submit antibiotics to use before any dentistry work is done.    I was floored when I had another dentistry give a quote of $52,000.     I have narcolepsy and cataplexy therefore I'm on disability and the $52,000 was way above my pay grade.    I know that without an examination, you cannot give a detailed cost estimate, however I believe there are fee scales your company utilizes.  If you could just give me a "best-case scenario" that would be greatly appreciated.    Thank you for your time. Betty

Hi there,   I recently went to a dentist within the preferred network for a filling that fell out, however my dentistry plan (Option 2) doesn't cover fillings and crowns (only cleaning and check-ups) and I am not able to afford new fillings and crowns as stipulated in the dental plan provided. I am therefore looking for other options and was referred to the Michigan School of Dentistry. I am able to get my X-rays from my current dentist but need to two procedures done, one getting a tooth filled in and the other (as recommended by the dentist) getting a crown put on a tooth that is likely to break in the next couple of months. I can provide these X-rays if they are required.   Can you please let me know what my options are, when I could get the procedures done and what the cost would be?  Kind regards Shane

Dear Sir/Madam.   Around 2002, when i was graduate student at University of Michigan, i regularly attended dental student clinic.  There I got an implant. I remember that I ( my implant) was a part of research project. They were investigating how effective is when crown is put on implant imnediately and not only after 6 months which was a standard procedure then.  At that time they did not issue me implant passport.  Now my dentist in Slovenia would like to know information about the implant that was put it, since he needs to do something on it.  So i wounder if you could check your records ( i hope you still have them) and provide me the information about my implant.   Looking forward to your replay.

Hello.  I am currently a patient of a dental student who is graduating this year (April.)  I've been having a very difficult time getting in touch with him and getting my next appointment scheduled.  The last message I got from him was on January 22.   He was going to pass me to another provider and I should have expected to hear from him/her the following day (1/23.)  So far I have not heard from anyone.    What do I need to do to get a new provider?  My current provider pulled all but 5 teeth on the bottom.  There is work to be done on my remaining teeth then dentures.  I'm basically without teeth right now.  I am going to need a new provider anyway so this may be a good time to get one while my current provider is still there.  Plus, my current provider is on rotation in February and will not be available.    I am in no way displeased with the services my current provider has provided.  He has done a excellent job in my opinion.  I just figure I'm going to need a new one and feel this may be the best time to make the switch.    Thank You,    Peter K. Doehring

Hi this is Jikun Liu. I am currently enrolled in the U of M and also in the Blue Cross insurance program. Previously I have submit a question through your platform somewhere around mid November on a previous paid bill on my visit for teeth removal, but it wasn't replied. It was about that I think I paid more than I should. The Blue Cross should have covered 90% of the surgery and basically all expenses in the process except for counseling, which summed around $110, but in the end I was billed $475.3, and I had no choice but paid it. Can you please tell me how the insurance work in this scenario? If I did pay more than I should, is there anything I can do now to get those payment back?

My Dentist informed me I need to have implants since I have several missing teeth on the bottom and the front teeth on the top are chipping and need a permanent soulution,  I tried a partial in the past and couldn't get used to it, and believe implants may be best.

Any consideration for help through the university would be greatly appreciated. I am a Michigan resident residing in Niles. Thanks, Duane

I have been told that I need 2 more implants. I’m just in the process of having one done now that is going to cost me $6000 and I certainly can’t afford two more at that price  and I was just wondering if that can be done at your facility?
I have not been a patient at Umich dentistry before but I have been having a really bad TMD flare up that has put my jaw and my gums on the affected side in a lot of pain to the point where it is hard to eat and makes me feel physically ill. What clinic would be best to go to for this issue?
I had my top teeth extracted back 10/19 with immediate denture. I've been having problems with them since then, not staying in, popping out. Have used adhesives still pop out when eating.  My question, do you do implants if so rough estimate cost for top, or any other ideas? I currently have 6 remaining on my lower which will have to be removed and placement of teeth there as well.  I live in Lansing so kind of a drive back and forth, can you give me options of cost to help me out?  Been without top teeth for almost 4 months self conscious already, having no teeth doesn't help.  Thank-you,   Charlene
I wanted to do how much would three bridges cost and braces?

how much does the first consultation visit cost?
I currently have Medicaid through the United Healthy Michigan Plan and am in need of a root canal. I understand my insurance will not cover the procedure, but am curious as to if I am able to make payments through the University of Michigan Dental offices after the procedure. It is hard for a college student like me to afford a $2000 (what my dentist office quoted me) up front in full payment. If it would benefit me more to call your offices, I just need to know the number to the correct office to speak to about my dilemma. Thank you!!
I need a teeth cleaning; can you assist? How much does it cost?
Cost for teeth cleaning. Cost for exrays
I am a patient at the School of Dentistry and I always had to pay my portion of services in full at every appointment. Due to loss of insurance, I had to suspend treatment until I had insurance again . I am ready to start treatments again and I am told I have a $160 balance. I don't understand what this is for since I was paying my costs at each appointment. My account is 914051.
Are you open Saturday

I work during your regular office hours.  I’ve contacted the Dental School twice trying to make an appointment for an exam and cleaning. I have Delta insurance.    I’m taking the day off on March 11 and since I need to have both things done in one day, the student clinic told me to ask faculty for an appointment.  I contacted faculty and was told I need a referral.  Since I haven’t been able to make an arrangement I’m writing to ask that you please collapse the process / sort it between departments and give me a 12:30 or later appointment on March 11.  If March 11 isn’t possible something around 9:00 AM after March 11 would work.  Thank you in advance for every favorable consideration!  Please write me back or call me at 248-762-1559 to confirm an appointment.  Elbert Clark December 12, 1946 1909 Knollwood Dr Canton, MI 48188

Hello there.  I've been going back and forth with my insurance company (Blue Cross Blue Shield) to get a bill from a dental cleaning at your clinic in October 2019 paid.  They advised me to pay it and are now saying that I shouldn't have.  They said to contact you guys for a reimbursement.  I can't wait on hold on the phone during work, so can someone from your billing department please call me to discuss?   313-338-8483 Thank you for your help with this.  I'm looking forward to having this finally resolved.

He is now 25 and when he went to a dentist he was told it would cost around $1500 every time he has his teeth cleaned. He works with the criminal justice system at the Jackson jail and their dental insurance will not cover most of the cost.  1. Can he be treated there? 2. Approx. cost? 3. What does he need to do? He is a great man who cares and I'm concerned with his health.  Thanks for reading this. Pam

Hello, I've been to the ortho clinic a few months ago for an evaluation to start my ortho treatment. I received a letter in the mail requesting a $265 check for imaging to start my treatment.

Please let me know, I haven't been able to reach anyone over the phone. Can I also drop off the money order instead because the due date is on March 31st? Thank you!

I am a current patient at UofM Ortho with a graduate student overseeing my Ortho journey. Since school is closed and for the most part students went home, is there any discussion about the graduate Ortho clinic opening up in the next few months once restrictions lighten up? And would you recall graduate Ortho students to come back for patient work or would the professors be replacing them? My very next appointment is actually just to debond my braces and finish my orthodontics so I just wanted to know what the executives have been discussing. But also, I understand safety of everyone should be a priority, I just wanted to know what was being discussed.  Thanks!

(Former patient of Doctor Dohr - 2019 / Skouteris, late 2019) i have no money, a gum / tooth infection, pain, bleeding, and fever. My dentist (Sara Bond) is not available. I have HAP senior plus & Delta Dental Premium. Can i get an appointment? Lauren Moore, 05/26/1958, 545 Perry St, Ypsilanti, MI 48197. Text or call 614-312-3232, please.
Hi again, Sherry!  4/20/20 Update to previous email on same day.  From:  Lauren Moore 545 Perry St, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 614-312-3232 (text or call)   HISTORY OF FEVER / INFECTIONS:  Dr. Skouteris (734-936-5950) & his associates at UM Oral Surgery performed surgery to remove the points of some of my VERY old jaw surgery screws late in 2019. The points of the screws were coming out at the left side of my tongue. It caused pain, fever and swollen glands near my left ear. (At that time, I was told there wasn’t much he could do because they were so embedded, and he would do his best. He was able to remove enough to stop the reinjury and resulting infections.)   On 2/14/2020, Dr. Jan Akervall (MOSA ENT 734-434-3200), performed sinus surgery to remove extensive infection and a small polyp that were completely blocking my left maxillary sinus cavity. He was unable to identify anything in my sinus that would cause it. Infection with visible pus was ongoing, with and without fever, off and on through 2019 to recently. Dr. Akervall has recommended that I see an oral surgeon, again, to determine if my chronic infections are being caused by the old screws.   Today (4/20/20) I contacted UM School of Dentistry (Sherry) because I now have an active gum/tooth infection in the same area, and across the entire left upper side of my mouth, so I suspect Dr. Akervall is right. This last infection has been bothering me for about a week, with fever and swollen glands near my left ear.   SYMPTOMS:  Throughout this entire period, 2019-now, I’ve had chronic fever, pain, heavy mucous drainage (From year-round and seasonal allergies. Also  possible reaction to gum infection?), with resulting chronic cough, sneezing, and when I have a fever, some shortness of breath. I am morbidly obese, since becoming disabled with chronic arthritis pain and lower-back sciatica and upper back radiculopathy to both arms.   MONEY:  My dentist, at Community Dental on Huron St, is unavailable, and holding (or refund is in limbo) a $110 pre-payment for a deep cleaning, which is all the money I have for this. I’m on SSDI and have no savings. I’m still waiting for a ‘stimulus’ check from the government. Their website says it won’t be mailed until April 24th.   INSURANCE:  HAP PRIMARY CHOICE MEDICARE HMO ID: 10048639600 Group ID: 100000261006 Delta Dental's Medicare Advantage PPO and Medicare Advantage Premier network  Today (4/20/20) I contacted my PCP (PA Grace Kelley (734) 985-7200 at Packard Health) to request a refill of antibiotics, and will call again to  request help with the medical clearance that UM Dental School requires for Covid-19.
Do you have a implant classes is there a cost ?
What is the price range for braces?
I am a current patient at UMich Dental. I have the Postal service system that notifies me that I am going to be receiving mail and who it is from. I received a notification that a letter was supposed to arrive a couple days ago from the school of dentistry, but it appears that it was delivered incorrectly or not delivered at all, because I still haven't received it. So, if it is something that is time-sensitive, I would like to request for it to be resent, or for someone to call me to notify me what the letter included. I just don't want to miss an important message. Thank you. 610-564-9938

I want to get braces on my bottom teeth. How much would it generally cost to get my teeth done?
I've taken the covid-19 test and passed it. Now that I've had 2 days of antibiotics, the infection has withdrawn to a smaller area around my furthest left-back tooth on upper jaw. (Yesterday I would have sworn it was one much closer to the front.)   The problem is, this again might mean that it's originating in my old jaw surgery screws, as Dr. Akervall suggested. Are you the contact point for Dr. Skouteris's office at UM Oral Surgery? He did my screw-point removal in late 2018 (incorrectly stated prev as 2019). If you are the contact person for him, I'd appreciate his help or a referral to someone who can help.   I have not had a fever since day before yesterday, and the pain and swelling along my gumline is much less. The pain is very much diminished. I'm starting to have stomach issues from the Augmentin, and am taking yogurt regularly, but I have a bad history with it (gastrointestinal) when used long term.  So I'm saying I either have to go back on the Clindamycin or get treatment relatively soon. I'm sending this same info to my PCP.   Thanks again for all you do.
Wondering if during pandemic scheduled payments for braces can be deferred for a couple of months due to not working for next few months

Of course the price is rediculous and I always have to use my care credit. I guess I'm just wondering if there is any savings to come to you guys instead? I just want to be out of pain and not pay an arm and a leg. If you could let me know what the fees are I'd greatly appreciate it. Thanks!

how can I get a copy of the treatment plan my student created with prices?
Are you able to do any sort of procedure? I have extensive teeth damage, would you be able to get everything done at once?
Hello, I am in need of significant dental work and have several missing teeth on the bottom and the front teeth on the top are chipping and need a permanent soulution. I tried a partial in the past and couldn't get used to it, and believe implants may be best. My Dentist gave me a list of what would  be needed. Implants on # 19,20,29 & 30 with crowns on #13 & 15 and a root canal on #2. I am recently retired and know I can't support the full cost. Being retired I have open availability. Any consideration for help through the university would be greatly appreciated. I am a lifelong Michigan resident residing in Niles. Thanks, Duane
Good afternoon. When do you all expect to be open again? Please and thank you.
This is Ryan Sternberg I'm one of dr joe fazzio's patients and I'm supposed to get my top bridge put in so please let me know when you're going to be scheduling non emergency appointments again?
Sherry, I've not heard back from you on whether I can get into see someone, to determine if my infection is teeth or old jaw-surgery screw related. I'm feeling better since being on the antibiotics, but I can't stay on them indefinitely, and I still have no hope that it will not come raging back after the prescription runs out. Do you want me to wait and see? Just looking for some direction here. Kinda clueless on my own. Thanks much.  Lauren.

Hi! How much would it cost to have 8-9 teeth pulled and to get a full set of dentures? My husbands teeth have been falling out for years now and he really needs dentures now.
Hello I believe I have a broken wisdom tooth upper right side of my mouth. Had it drilled and filled less than year ago at Arbor West Dental. He said it would be fine About about a week ago the feeling and 1/4 of the tooth broke out. As of this morning I finally noticed pain. Does this qualify for emergency dental procedure? If so I would like to make an appointment. Thanks for reading.
My brother has lost a lot if teeth.  He is a senior citizen living on SS.  He has no savings!  Can he get dentures through your program.  He needs help bad!
I have been told by 3 Orthodontists that I need braces to help with shifting teeth and my jaw misalignment. My Insurance doesn't cover any Orthodontics and I wanted to find out the cost of getting braces through the school to see how it compares. Ann Arbor is far from my home, so I was hoping to get an estimate before I set anything up. Thank you.
Hi I was looking to have oral surgery for my two bottom wisdom teeth. I was wondering if we could set up an appointment for extraction because the pain has gotten a lot worse and now my teeth are shifting really bad.

We are patients at the Orthodontic Clinic. I would like to contact our orthodontics grad student assigned to my son, Spencer Bauman (07/15/2005). Dr. Bates was slated to graduate this spring. Due to the shut down, we have not been seen since December. I wanted to check in with the clinic to inquire about our new grad student - who is going to attend Spencer, if Dr. Bates has graduated. Thank you for your help.
Hi, I was seen in January for a consultation to get Invisalign. I was referred to the orthodontics clinic and was suppose to get a letter in the mail during the month of March telling me the cost of treatment.   Unfortunately, I had to move back to my hometown during the month of March because of COVID, so I haven't been able to read that letter.   Could you possibly mail me another copy of the letter, showing me the cost of Invisalign treatment, to my new address?? My new address is 918 Maple Ave Jackson, MI 49203.   If possible, you can also email it to me-- my email address is suneetp@med.umich.edu  Thank you so much!
Will you be reopening at 50% of appointment availability?

Hello, Do you accept the CareCredit card as payment for services?  Thank You!
My wife has had a number of medical issues over the years.  She's had a lot of Cortisone shots which affected her teeth.  She lost most of them so she is required to get implants on the top and bottom.  They said she needs some bone graphs so doesn't qualify for dentures. She is an amazing Mom and wife so would like to somehow get her in somewhere at a way cheaper price than $30,000-$40,000.   I can send you before (great smile) and after (no smile) if you want.  I appreciate anything you can do.   I am a Michigan fan if that helps.  lol
My dad needs teeth pulled and a plate for dentures on the top. He lives in Florida and does not have dental insurance. What is the cost per tooth to be pulled and a top plate and top dentures.
My hometown dentist told me i would need a procedure done to pull down my top k-nine tooth (sorry for terminology) because it has not come down on its own and i was wondering if i could come in for a consultation to see if i could have it done at the U? Thank you!
How much do dental implants cost, the implant, the abutment and the crown?

Current patient, cracked a tooth this am.  Are emergency services available?  My oral surgeon is Dr. Chen.
Hello! This isn’t a question, but rather some feedback for the Pediatric School of Dentistry. We took my 6 year old son to several “kid friendly” general dentists in our area who were unable to treat him due to his situational anxiety. We then took him to a local pediatric dentist who’s treatment plan was to send him to the OR for thousands of dollars out of pocket. I am so thankful that we pursued treatment at U of M instead. Through their behavioral methods they have been able to work with my son to get his treatment completed without drastic measures. We are so happy with our experience at the clinic and are grateful that we can get his treatment done in an environment that is able and equipped to work with him behaviorally. Thank you!!

I had an appointment that had to be cancelled. I'd like to get another one scheduled, perhaps in the fall (in hopes you can see me by then). Is that possible?
Is there any word on when the dental school will reopen? I am an existing patient.

Hi, I have a filled tooth but the filling material fell yesterday. It is not painful but sensitive to hot and cold. I just wonder is it necessary for me to make an emergency appointment to refill that tooth in this case?

Lauren Moore (DOB: 05/26/1958)  545 Perry St, Ypsilanti, MI 48197 614-312-3232 (text or call - please leave message if calling)  HISTORY:   5/22/2020  Emergency Dental Appt at UM Dental School. Saw Dr. Green. He very thoroughly examined me and my x-ray scans, and could not find anything that justified ‘anything drastic’. No sign of infection, tissue problems, or signs of irritation around metal plates. He carefully compared my past (2012 - because the latest 2018 x-rays and MRIs were not accessible to him, even though the 2018 surgery was done at UM) and present scans, and spent a great deal of time explaining and going over his findings. I was very impressed by his caring and professionalism. I have no criticism of him or his office, or his staff. They treated me exceptionally well.   Since Dr Green was unable to find a reason for my infection, he had me escorted upstairs the Oral Surgery office, for further examination, and to provide the final word on whether it was related at all to my old jaw surgery hardware, or something else.   COMPLAINT: Even though it was an emergency dental appointment, and Dr. Green needed this followup by Oral Surgery, and I’d signed documents that said “payment is expected at the time of service for non-emergent treatment”, I was thrown out of Oral Surgery because I did not have money in hand for my treatment, and they do not accept my insurance. I was not allowed to talk to an oral surgeon or make an appointment. I was told it was a ‘new policy since the corona virus outbreak”. This makes no sense to me. And it was not in the paperwork I signed.   4/3/2020: My pre-paid $110 April 3rd cleaning appointment at Community Dental Center (Huron St, Ypsilanti, Dr. Bond — they accept the dental insurance that I pay an extra $41 a month for, from my Social Security Disability income) was cancelled due to Covid-19. At that time, I requested a refund, since I knew I’d have to use the money to get treatment for the infection. (I found out later that the office failed to put through the refund. I am still waiting for it.) They suggested I could travel 2+ hours (one-way) or more to different dental offices that were accepting emergency appointments. Since I am disabled by extreme chronic pain, driving that far is not feasible. They suggested I could call UM Dental. So I did. Since it was recommended by my doctor that I call for an emergency dental appointment, that’s what I did.   4/24/2020: Grace Kelley at Packard Health prescribed Clindamycin HCL 300mg Capsules 4xD for 10 days, at my request, due to Augmentin stomach issues and little effectiveness. As of late April 2020, seems to be working to hold off infection. Now much less pain and sensitivity in top left gum-line, no fever. Some pain in gland (?) near left ear. Brushing and flossing still hurts. Salt rinses are done twice daily. Brushing twice a day. Flossing once a day. Grace Kelley recommended I call for an emergency dental appointment.   4/22/2020: Received medical clearance, from Covid-19 test at Arbor Park Medical.   4/20/2020 Augmentin - 875 mg-125 mg tablets for 7 days. Prescribed by Grace Kelly at Packard Health for infection (swelling, bleeding, pain in upper left gum-line and teeth, fever upon waking of 99.9 with maximum Ibuprofen use.)  4/20/20: I contacted my PCP (PA Grace Kelley (734) 985-7200 at Packard Health) to request a refill of antibiotics (she prescribed Augmentin), and for help with the medical clearance that UM Dental School requires for Covid-19.  4/20/20: I contacted UM School of Dentistry (Sherry) because I now seem to have an active gum/tooth infection in the same area, and across the entire left upper side of my mouth, so I suspect that possibly Dr. Akervall is right. Maybe? This last infection has been bothering me for about a week, with fever and painful gland near my left ear.   2/14/2020, Dr. Jan Akervall (MOSA ENT 734-434-3200), performed sinus surgery to remove extensive infection and a small polyp that were completely blocking my left maxillary sinus cavity. He was unable to identify anything in my sinus that would cause it. Infection with visible pus was ongoing, with and without fever, off and on through 2019 to recently. Dr. Akervall has recommended that I see an oral surgeon, again, to determine if my chronic infections are being caused by the old screws. I don’t know what good that will do, because Dr. Skouteris said there wasn’t anything else he could do to remove more of the screws.   Late 2019? I was referred to Dr. Akervall by my dentist, Dr. Sara Bond, at Community Dental Center, Huron Street, Ypsilanti. I was not treated by my dentist.   Oct / Dec 2018: Dr. Skouteris (734-936-5950) & his associates at UM Oral Surgery performed surgery to remove the points of some of my VERY old jaw surgery screws, late in 2018. The points of the screws were coming out at the left side of my tongue. It caused pain, fever and swollen glands near my left ear. (At that time, I was told there wasn’t much he could do because they were so embedded, and he would do his best. He was able to remove enough to stop the re-injury and resulting infections.)   SYMPTOMS:  Throughout this period, 2019-now, I’ve had chronic fever, pain, heavy mucous drainage (drainage also from year-round and seasonal allergies. Possible reaction to gum infection / sinus blockage?), with resulting chronic cough, sneezing, and sometimes (unusual) shortness of breath upon exercise.   INSURANCE:  HAP PRIMARY CHOICE MEDICARE HMO ID: 10048639600 Group ID: 100000261006 Delta Dental's Medicare Advantage PPO and Medicare Advantage Premier network  MONEY:  My dentist, at Community Dental on Huron St, is unavailable, and holding (or refund is still in limbo) a $110 pre-payment for a deep cleaning, which is all the money I have for this. The refund has still not been posted. I’m on SSDI and have no savings. All I was asking for, was to be billed.

Do you have any idea when the clinics will be taking appointments?
When will you be open to start accepting new patients?  I realize we are in the middle of a pandemic situation and businesses have been ordered to shut down but I’m just wondering if you have a date when you’ll be open to seeing a new patient.  I would like to set up an appointment to see somebody.  I know I have to do that first and then you guys will work out what comes next.   My smile is atrociously scary, teeth missing in front and I look like homemade ka-ka...  Thank you. Martha

how much is a complete set of upper implants my front teeth are loose and my left side aches at about a 3 all the time i can have my dentist dr. sharon dow un jonesville mi. send you xrays
I had an emergency visit a couple weeks ago in California and was scheduled to get a root canal 2 days later, but could not afford the $2300 price because my husband is out of work and that's a huge chunk out of our savings, so decided to wait until I got back to Michigan. I already had the antibiotics and I'm not in pain anymore, but I'd like to get a root canal ASAP. This tooth already has an older crown & has caused me pain on and off for about a year. I thought it was due to grinding.  I know you need a referral, so I might be able to get my records from that office in California or could I maybe schedule x-rays with you and then get the root canal?  Thanks a lot. I didn't think this was a true emergency, so I'm writing instead of calling.

Dental insurance options (for root canal/endodontists) for incoming UMich student in Fall 2020

Hello!  I’m trying to get my wisdom teeth extracted and every oral surgeon I’ve been to have either not been able to accept my insurance or doesn’t specialize in unique cases.  The reason it’s unique is because of the way my teeth are growing in. My top wisdom teeth are both impacted and my bottom left tooth is coming in completely sideways. My bottom right is coming in at a 45 degree angle and is slightly exposed, causing decay in the tooth it’s touching. They’re all applying pressure therefore it is necessary for them to be pulled. Is there anything your students can do to help a situation like mine? Thank you.

Patient Question: Deteriorating Temporary Filling  Dr. Sweier referred me to Dr. Richard Gardner, who on June 15, 2020 performed a Root Canal in a single-appointment, finishing with a  Temporary Filling.  I could not be more satisfied With Dr. Gardner and his work, the  procedure and the at-home recovery were both problem-free.  While waiting for the School of Dentistry to open back up so that I can get a Crown for this tooth, and despite my best efforts, (not chewing-on  and gentle-brushing), the Temporary Filling has started to deteriorate.  I have been replacing the lost filling material with the over-the-counter product “Dentemp”, which is described as for Lost Filling Repair.  This situation has not cause any discomfort and using the Dentemp is not a problem.   My question is; should I be doing something else while waiting for the  School of Dentistry to open.  I do not want to go to a private-practice Dentist for a Crown.  Thank you in advance for your help.  Sincerely,   Robert Rion

Hi. I have Medicaid, Blue Cross Complete. I am immune compromised. Last I knew my insurance didn’t cover anything that would save a tooth. I have 3+molars which are dead or on their way their. Possible infection(s.) pain lately, but it’s probably been over a year for some of the over all symptoms. I am 38. I started having tooth trouble during pregnancy and autoimmune diseases and medication. Never a cavity before 31. Now I feel like my whole mouth is on the way out...  I guess I just want to know, as I am high COVID risks, what is suggested and if anyone takes my insurance one hundred percent. I have been terrified of coming in. Even getting my first fillings and extraction ‘healing’ during pregnancy were very painful to me.   Is there a way, if I need several extractions to do them at once or take an antibiotic first? And then do them under anesthesia? 😱   And then if so, what is the amount this would be that my insurance would not cover?   Could a payment plan be created?   What is total due, for say 3 probable extractions?   Are root canals feasible with my insurance? What part could be covered with it, if any?   I apologize for so much information and delay.   Please advise?
It says open to the public on your website, but then you say you are not providing non-emergency care, so whats going on? I would like to be a patient.

Thanks so much.    :)
Hi, in emergency (bad tooth pain abscess etc...) does the dental school have emergency dentist anytime. How does it work .thanks
Hello! I am interested in a potential dental visit. I have a cavity filling which came out a while ago but the recent world events made getting dental appointments near impossible at the time. The tooth from which the filling came out of has since developed a crack in it and part of it is loose, so I am guessing it's a tooth removal? I also have a couple of newer cavities that I know will have to be taken care of as well. Further, my oral hygiene has suffered since childhood (I am 32) and would need a thorough cleaning and inspection and the advice of the dentist.  I do not have dental insurance but my credit is excellent and I am more than comfortable with standard costs and payment plans.
Hello! I am looking for advanced braces (self ligating) and I’m wondering if the u of m orthodontics provides this. Additionally, I spoke to someone about being a patient and they said they were going to mail me the forms, but I’m wondering if there is a waitlist/ wait time. Thank you!

Hi!   I mildly chipped a tooth today and was wondering if this would fall under an emergency dentist visit.  Thanks!
I am a regular patient and had a filling drop out on Sunday, July 26. can I come into the clinic and have it replaced? my number is 517 599 4318
I need a couple implants.  How do i get started?
Are previously scheduled appointments (ie scheduled before covid19 pandemic) still standing? When I called, the phone message said UM Dentistry is not taking any new non-emergency patients, but did not address what patients who have an upcoming (non-urgent) appointment should do. If previously scheduled appointments are cancelled, will UM Dentistry reach out to schedule a new appointment or will I need to continue calling back? Thank you!

Hi, I am getting an oral surgery done next summer. I live in Denver, but I go to college at the University of Michigan.

Hello, I have TMJ and am looking for someone that specializes in this area  and could fabricate me a new bite splint. I have never been here before. I was told there was no one specific in my area which is Lansing. I have not had the best luck with the dentist and my periodontist who treated me for TMJ retired. Is there an option to coming to your school? Thank You.
I have a 15 year old who needs massive dental work. He had a deep underbite, would need a cemented spacer on top for a few months, a removable spacer afterwards and then braces. I know this is a teaching school and I was wondering if this would be a case that would be worth teaching to the dental students. I'm unsure if my insurance (Meridian through the state) would cover this, but I am desperate. He gets bullied at school, he is ashamed of his smile and his overall self esteem has dropped to barely anything. I'm a single mom, living with MY mom. My dad passed away last January and my mom and I are trying to survive on my state help and her social security. If you can help in ANY way or can point me in the right direction, please let me know.  Thanks so much for your time, Jennifer Stafiej
I am a patient of dr Pandovano who just graduated. My braces fell off. Please help me.
a few months ago i had an extraction done of tooth #15.  Since then i have  had tp return to the dentist twice for spur removals and the last time he cut my gums open to smooth the jaw bone.  I took antibiotics and used the dental paste as prescribed, but now i have two white spots on my gums, there is pain, I dont feel right, my cheekbone hurts, and I feel like there is an infection in the bone or something.  I dont trust this dentist and Im not sure which number to call or who to see at the dental clinic.

I cracked a bit of one of my molars, and though the pain isn't extreme, I wonder if this is considered a dental emergency?  It seems to be sensitive to both hot and cold.

How much would a front tooth implant cost approximately? You
I have a question about appointment scheduling - in March I saw Joshua Brown for a comprehensive exam with a plan to see him in 3 months but also to schedule on a Thursday so I could also see another dentist there who deals with sleep apnea dental appliances. In addition, I had an April appointment with Lahari Vattikunta in the Periodontics clinic for a review / maintenance appointment. I need to schedule with each of these again, but am not sure which I would need to schedule first as well as when they're available in the month of September or October. If you could please contact me at my e-mail address above or by telephone at (734) 546-5829 I would greatly, greatly appreciate it. Thank you and have a nice day.

I am low income but I am sort of at a crisis situation. I do not have insurance and have not been able to have dental care in over 10 yrs. At this point. It is an absolute necessity to my health to deal with. I have a child and I cannot eat much, and I'm worried with how bad it has gotten that I could die from infection if it happens.

Can you find the mercy to help me, ir to point me in a direction to get help? I'm scared and worried, please contact me anytime, any way. If I do not answer PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE. 248- 979-2455.

I have broken/cracked two teeth, I presently do not have a dentist as the dentist I began restoration on other teeth has closed down due to pandemic.  Are there any treatment options for me with the University?  Thank you.
I was at the dentist today and I cannot get over how nasty the receptionist was to me.  I am in an incredible amount of pain and instead of compassion, she was annoyed.  After my appointment was set up, I asked if I was all set to go and she said yes.  When I called back an hour later to request my x-rays, she told me I couldn't have them because I skipped out on paying.  SHE TOLD ME I WAS SET TO GO.  I'm considering changing dentists at this point.  I think her name was Maggie.

I have a 37 year old daughter who has no dental insurance, she had her teeth cleaned by her dentist office she goes to, the dentist is recommending she see a periodontist every other time for teeth cleaning due to her gums.  She can not afford to go to a periodontist for cleanings every other time.  Could she come to the dental school for a cleaning from a periodontist once a year?  She just had her teeth cleaned last week so would not be due for 6 months.  I am inquiring, as I have guardianship, as she is a disabled adult.  Please respond as I would like to get something set up.

Do you offer services from the Regenerative Dentistry program at your clinics?
I was a patient there for years, and I was told that evidently I would need a procedure done to save my teeth from failing out because I have excessive gum erosion. Well, I been in Canada for 2 years and things just got bad. Is this considered a dental emergency? Because I ate a corn chip and I tore a bunch of tissue. Also, I am an autoimmune patient so I been extremely careful during this pandemic by wearing two masks and googles etc!   989-313-9977  James Ramsey
I read on Webmd about direct and indirect pulp capping as an alternative to root canal. Is this a procedure that UM would consider? Or can you recommend a dentist that does?
Hello, we recently had exams, x-rays and estimates for our 4 and 5 year Olds. Totals are several thousand dollars after insurance (Delta Dental) for deep cavities, extractions, child crowns. My sister suggested I contact a dental school. Is this something a school would be able to handle?
Arte you open for Cleanings?? Thank you.
I was born without most of my permanent teeth I’ve had bridge work in for 31 years and need it redone. I’m 56 is this something your students would learn from and maybe do?
One of my upper back teeth had a filling come out and the tooth split. It stays together on soft food but eating a steak I chew on one side of my mouth. My dentist quoted $2,400 to pull half the tooth and put a crown over the rest. I have Guardian High Plan Dental Insurance. Will the dental school charge less for a student to learn how to do this on a real patient?
My son, myles Bisson, had an ortho consult that was cancelled in March. When can we expect that to be rescheduled?

I have guardianship of my disabled and blind niece. She needs dental work under anesthesia. We have been working with OSU as she has straight Ohio Medicaid and they are the only ones who accept it in the state of Ohio. They are closed until further notice. My niece goes to Kellogg Eye Institute and sees cardiology at the U of M. She has had numerous surgeries at U of M as well. Do you accept Ohio Medicaid and can she get in for treatment? We have been working with OSU for three years only to have covid hit and no care for her. She has lost 30 lbs in 3 months as she is not eating and cannot tell us what is hurting. We know it is her teeth and she needs to be seen ASAP. She is a forgotten part of society as a disabled adult and services are not available. Thanks!

I am looking at false teeth and removal of around 20 teeth. I would like approximate cost if possible.
I don't have a question, rather a criticism. As a result of trauma to my mouth, tooth number eight became necrotic. I mistakenly placed my trust in the UM dental faculty to give me the best outcome for my oral health. After several failed root canals, I was referred to the student implant clinic which ultimately ruined any chances of having a stable outcome for my teeth. Years later, I now suffer from significant bone loss, and face losing even more teeth as a result of the damaging procedures performed by both faculty and students at the UM clinic. Not only has my smile, my self confidence, and my faith in medical professionals been ruined, my health has been forever compromised due to the negligence and harmful practices of the UM dental school. I will suffer from this trauma for the rest of my life, which best case scenario will be several decades since I'm only 36. I just want the dental school to know that I will forever tell everyone I know to avoid entrusting their health with the UM school of dentistry.
Hello, I understand that currently you're not taking any new patients due to the COVID crisis. Is there any news on when new patients will be accepted? A few days ago, one of my front teeth started feeling very sensitive (it tingles occasionally, usually when touched by my tongue or food). Although I have increased my brushing to after every meal, I fear it might be the onset of a cavity. If there's no news to share, do you have any suggestions for nearby dentists covered by Delta Dental that may be able to assist me?
Hello I need a crown, currently I dont have health insurance, I would like to know how much does it cost having it here? Thank you

I'm a Umich studnet who recently got my wisdom teeth removed by a local surgeon in Grand Rapids, about 2 weeks ago and am experiencing some abnormal pain and discoloration.

Does your student clinic do dental implants?  If so, what might that typically cost? If not, do you have a more advanced school that does this procedure and who would I call for more information about it?  Teeth needing replacement are in position 19 and maybe 20 also.  Thanks.

Do you accept United Concordia Tricare? I have a 13 yr old that needs braces and was quoted 6200. for underbite work. My Mom recommended you all for him.
Do you do veneers that do not hurt the teeth and the cost?
Are root canals covered by  straight medicaid?
Sorry to bother but I asked a similar question a few days ago and did not hear a response. I have a dental situation which I do not believe is an emergency, at least not yet. A certain tooth in my mouth has started to feel strangely sensitive. I upped my brushing to three times a day to counter what I thought was a developing cavity. However now the whole area feels strange (not necessarily painful but completely different from the rest of the mouth). I'm worried it will continue to get worse at this rate. Should I call and try to schedule an appointment with you? I don't really know what exactly constitutes a dental emergency.
are you doing implants currently
Hello, I was wondering if clinic has opened up? I needed to make an appointment regarding a remake of my bite splint that broke a couple of months ago.

Forwarding records of care to a provider out of state
To whom it may concern, Iam writing in regards to my son Ryder DeHate. I am seeking financial help for some orthodontic work for him. Ryder is a 9 year old boy who struggles with a learning disability and speech problems. Do to these issues he has anxiety and depression issues which we constantly struggle to stay on top of. Part of his speech issues could be helped with some orthodontic work. Ryder has a bad overbite and his teeth project out over his bottom lip which makes it hard and almost impossible for him to project certain sounds even though he attends speech classes in school.  Ryder has Medicaid and Cigna insurance and with a large family it is hard to find the means to come up with all the expanses . Any assistance at all would be greatly appreciated to help him. Any questions please call me 989-854-1164 thank you.    Thank you for your time,                       Richard De Hate

How much for full set of implants
Hi my name is Christine and I am my mom’s co-guardian. She is 62 and does not have dental insurance. She broke a tooth and probably needs it taken out. Is there any way I could get information on how much this would cost to get done here and how long it would take to get her an appointment? Any information would be helpful!

My father lives in assisted living and is wheelchair bound and cannot transfer without significant help.  They had a dentist come in and the referral reads: extract #23-26, and any other root tips remaining under the patient's gum.  We have been told he is in pain.  He has Medicare and Mutual of Omaha supplemental insurance (which does not cover dental) and he has Medicaid.  He has dementia but is usually cooperative.  We would have to have a service transport him.  Are you able to help?  The nursing home said to contact you, however, I cannot get ahold of anyone to speak with.  I hope you can help - we don't know where to take him.  Thank you!

Hi, one of my teeth lost more than half of it and I think it is a dental emergency, can I make an appointment now?
I was at the Dental School with my disabled sister Amy Cummings on October 22, 2020. Between 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM. I would like to know how I can file a complaint against a rude and disrespectful employee at the 2nd floor Information and Cashier Counter for harrassing me about wearing a mask. I don't mind wearing a mask in a healthcare facility. I completely understand the importance of wearing a mask in a healthcare facility and I understand the concepts of universal precautions. However, I tried to explain to the employee that I have sinus problems and I feel like she completely ignored what I said. Furthermore, The employee stated that I can wait outside in my vehicle. That's not going happen either because I'm a court appointed legal guardian for my disabled sister and I have the legal right to be present during any all medical care.    I think your employees need to work on being more courteous and understanding of people who have trouble wearing masks instead of being rude and extremely disrespectful.

I have two primary teeth and am starting to plan for their removal and replacement. I'd like to confirm the individual costs at the grad student clinic for this process, including: 1. extraction 2. implant 3. abutment 4. implant + crown  Are there any other costs associated with this kind of operation? I would be a new patient to the dental school clinic.  I am a U-M employee and am deciding between Options 2 and 3 with Delta Dental. From what I've learned so far, I should start the process towards the end of next year by having one tooth extracted and get an implant, and then do the abutment, etc. three months later (in a new calendar year); and then repeat the process for the second tooth in the next calendar year.  Thanks for any info or insight.  -Sara Holliday

My family physician suggested I contact you since I don’t have dental coverage and he was aware of your dental school of helping people with limited income and no dental insurance.  Most of my teeth are in advanced state of decay and need to be removed.  I once qualified for Medicaid, but when my children reached the age of 18, the state changed our family of 4 status to 2 causing me and my wife to become ineligible for Medicaid leaving me without any sort of dental coverage. If you can assist me, it would be a great relief since my teeth are quite painful and it’s difficult for me to eat.

Do you do dentures?
A dental hygienist at my dentist’s office whose boss attended U of M Dental School had suggested that I would be a perfect candidate for one of your students to “practice on.” I believe that I have an entire set of teeth that need to be capped, however the expense would be outrageous thus I’ve been listening to Dr Winn talk about winning the lottery for years to fix my teeth. After living with the pain and discomfort long enough I thought that I’d ask your school the question that I regret so have to ask. I’ll explain. I’ve appealed an unfavorable ruling by the Department of Veterans Affairs after serving in the Navy for 21 years that my condition (bruxism/ teeth grinding) was the result of my service  while in the Navy. It could be another year or more before I get a decision. I don’t know. With no where else to turn other than my children’s college funds, my retirement or my credit union for a sizable loan, I figured “What the heck?”  If I could help your dental program and in return get some relief of the constant pain; at times pretty bad in the form of “free dental work” I would be happy to fill out the forms or have my dentist contact you and go from here. You can always say “No. Your dentist was misinformed.”  Thank you for your reply!
I have Medicaid, and I have 10 teeth that need to be pulled and need dentures. I went to a dentist oct last year, but was in assisted living at the time. Due to Covid, I could not go back.

I have to have nitrous, or anxiety won’t allow you in my mouth.  9 teeth are on the bottom front, and the 10th is top left wisdom tooth, all are broken down to the just out of the gum.

How do I look up past visit information and bills?
Hello, prior to the pandemic, my daughter was seen at the pediatric clinic. After our appointment, I tried to pay, which is completely out of pocket, and was told there was no charge, I explained that there had to be because we do not have insurance. I was told she can’t charge me if she isn’t seeing a balance. Now I’ve been sent a bill from collections. I am happy to pay this immediately, but when I speak to this collections office they cannot guarantee that upon payment this will not negatively affect my credit. I would like to get this resolved as soon as possible. Thank you so much for any help you can provide.

I am a new patient to the school. My previous dentist recently took radiographs and clinical photographs of tooth #14 and #19. He recommended I get "bruxing crowns" (CEREC) with a core build up on both teeth. Alternatively, he proposed a PFM crown for both teeth. I have CIGNA dental insurance. I was wondering how much these treatment options would cost at the school of dentistry. If you could send me a pricing breakdown, that would be great. Thanks.

I have been trying now for over a week to have $45 credited to my credit card for a service I did not have rendered. I spoke today at 9:30 am on Nov. 10 to (I believe) Jolene or Jolie, who told me that I would received a call back after 11 am. It is now 5 pm and I have not heard back from anyone. I originally spoke to someone about this more than a week ago, and was told I could expect someone to call me back last week to take my credit card info. No one did. I'd appreciate it if someone could follow up on this.

I had a molar removed in February, and Ive been trying to set up an appointment with Periodontics but cant reach them, I can only leave a voice mail. Every time i call I get an answering service, not a person. The department has replied to a few of the voice mails, but not all. I cant reach them and set up an appointment to start the process of getting an implant. I have left an email address to contact me. I need some help here.

Hello. I'm james from adrian michigan. Over the years my teeth continue to get worst and worst. Alot of chips, broken, rotten teeth. I'm only 30. I don't have insurance at the time and never really have. I work 38 hours a week. Was wondering do I need insurance? Can you guys do major work at a reduced price? Anything you can tell me would help. I would love to smile again. As I've gotten older I've realized how important you're teeth really are, and how they effect you personally. Thanks again

Are there Spanish speaking dental associates ?
I am interested in bringing my kids for orthodontia and oral surgery.  One (17yrs) also has a seizure disorder. His neurologist is at UM Mott’s, do you work with them for patient safety. Is there anything I would need to do to facilitate that process?  Lastly, I do not see an area for new patients- that page says October, it’s now November. But there are no options to advance into an appointment request.  The one needing surgery needs it soon according to our dentist.

I have been a patient at the Ann Arbor clinic for several years. I wrote to you 2 weeks ago concerning a tooth that has broken off my partial. I've gotten no response.

I appreciate your attention on this matter.

Do you except Meridian Insurance?
Hi, are you currently accepting new patients? If you are, do you accept the Option 1 insurance through the University of Michigan?
My son, who is the patient, is a minor.  Will I be allowed in the dental school waiting area while he is being seen?
This is going to be awkward. But it just kind of hit me that I think I may have been offensive. I just wanted to apologize to Anya at Faculty practice, I spoke to her on the phone and you know I am just a genuinely curious person, I am also sometimes overbearing. I am specifically talking about where I tried to recall some german I learned over 20 years ago and she told me what I said was offensive or could be offensive. I never really thought about it until just now, on whether she was telling that what I was saying was considered offensive and actually took offense as well or not. On the abundance of caution. You know I am really trying hard out here to learn as much as I can and connect with people from all backgrounds. It's really tough sometimes. I'm really trying to put my best foot forward. Anyways I hope this helps.

Need to know is dental insurance required for single tooth implant? What would the fee and charge would be? Are you starting to accept new patients? Thanks!
I cannot afford dental help. I have 8 teeth that need extracting at least and at least 4 of them are broken down to the gum. Its causing sinus issues which in turn causes more dental pain. I dont qualify for the dental care plan and there is not one single dentist in northern michigan who will help me unless I have literally thousands of dollard to hand over in a lump payment. There is no dentist who will work a payment plan. I have been resorting to breaking my own teeth down to relieve pressure and pain. I was told colleges do pro Bono work. Ive been living like this for almost ten years. Is there anyone who can help me? Before anyone gives me back lash on breaking my own teeth out please just dont. I have not had a choice in the matter. I know the dangers, but no dentist around here cares about the patient they care what the patient can pay. I just need to know if I have to let my teeth end up killing me or is there someone who can save me. I have lost all hope in this matter. Im reaching out just out of pure desperation.

I have tooth #10 that had a root canal and a crown. The crown broke at the gum line. I need to have the tooth extracted in order to get the tooth ready for an implant. To see an oral surgeon for a consult I have to wait until January 11th. Can you do anything sooner? The tooth originally broke at the pulp cap. I had that done approximately 50 years ago. Then about 20 years ago I had a root canal and new crown. Thank you

I am interested in being seen by a faculty dentist at UM Dentistry and was wondering whether or not the clinic was accepting new patients. The website says you are not, however I have reason to believe it is not up to date given that it also says new patients will start being accepted in October of 2020. Please advise.

I deal with specific phobia and anxiety and I was wondering if you do sedative dentistry for cavity fill/discoloration fixing. I have a tooth that needs it and I am looking into sedative dentistry to get it done as I’ve never had a cavity before and my specific phobia is very bad and I’m afraid of how I’ll react. I am also not currently as afraid of the dentist and would like to preserve that by limiting my trauma and fear reactions/associations with the dentist. I am 24 years old for reference. Thank you in advance :)

His Medicaid does not cover orthodontics and I was wondering if there was and financial help programs such as the U of M health financial assistance plan. I qualified for 100% assistance with U of M after insurance, but they said to reach out to you because the Dental School dose not participate in their assistance program, and they may have a plan. Thank you.
I've never had any dental preventative care, no fillings, no cleanings, nothing.  I'm 60 yrs old and want more than anything to have a bright white smile - implants.  How do I start my journey?
Are Invisalign services offered for a cheaper rate than through a standard dentist?
I want to know how much does it cost to do root canal treatment and the crown? I need the cheapest option. I do have BCBS insurance that limits 1,200 per year and I went to the dentist closest to my house. After the cleaning and the xray procedure they did, I have about 830 left in my insurance, and it will cost me a lot from out of pocket to do the root canal and the crown. So, I am looking for a cheaper option. thanks

I have ground my teeth quite a bit and have been told that the only way to fix my mouth is with a” major overhaul” which includes capping several teeth at a time. Last I checked, it would be 10s of thousands of dollars.  Are there any pro bono or research projects on the horizon at your dental school?  If not,  how much are caps/ tooth?  Thank you.
My father is on Medicare with a fixed income.  He is in need of major dental work/possible dentures.  Is this something that is offered at the dental school?
I'm having trouble with my insurance letting me get planing and scaling due to fact I don't have enough bone loss. I'm 23 years old and I honestly don't want the gingivitis to eat my bones away to finally get help. Being a veteran I have asked the VA for dental help,  but it must be an emergency only or life threatening. Do you know of any periodontist in your services that could help me with this problem or refer me to someone who can assist me in finding where to go. Thank you for your time.

I received ebt/snap benefits and my insurance is with the state do u guy accept it
In early 2020, I was told by Dental Clinics North that I needed at least 6-7 Crowns....this was previous to COVID.  Currently, due to COVID, I cannot afford them.  Back Ground:  My only source of income is SSD-Brain tumor survivor since 4/2009.  Taking this into consideration:  What can you do for me?   Do you accept any supplemental insurance plans?  Which ones?  Do you accept Care Credit?  Are there different levels of service tiers?  I have been to your dental clinic previously...in which you pulled my wisdom teeth.  The improvement in my vision was totally amazing and instant.  I appreciate your time and effort in doing a little research for me.  Thank you !
Do you do Root Canals and Crowns? I need 4 done and the cost of 3 will be 5000$ and I cannot afford to pay that much out of pocket all at once

My name is Linda and I work in the medical records department of The Lighthouse Neurological Center, a home for the traumatic brain injured and we provide all of their care along with scheduling appointments.  I have 2 patients with referrals to U of M Dental.  Is there a way to email the referral information instead of doing the referral online through the U of M referral site? Or if we can continue to fax the referrals?   The referring dental office is having a hard time completing the referral due to needing the medical history, medication lists, and other patient history.  I have the patient information but cannot complete the dental office portion. Before paper referrals were no longer accepted, the referring doctor would fill out the referral and then our nurses would fill out the medical history. Once completed, I would be the one to fax it to the referred hospital and make the appointment. We’re having a bit of a challenge getting it all completed by one person so we were looking to see if there was another way to get these referrals over to U of M. If you could please get back to me with any help, I would appreciate it. I emailed the external referral help site and they responded to contact patient services and someone from this team should be able to help.   Thank You
I went to a clinic here and they said I have to have the rest of my teeth on top taken out and some broken ones on the bottom. 11 in total. I have terrible panic attacks and had 3 of them just doing the x-rays. They said I needed to go somewhere that I could be put to sleep. They gave me your information because they said you would accept my Medicaid insurance. So I just need to know if you do accept it and if you do can you set me up an appointment.
Hello, I am in need of two wisdom teeth to be removed. I currently have no insurance. I was wondering if there was anyway to set up some sort of payment plan? Or if I could make a down payment towards my extraction? I was just asking around because I really need this done. Thank you.
Hi, I have an appointment related to extracting the wisdom teeth on November 16th. I did a panoramic film and evaluation last time and the doctor said she had sent an email to the insurance company to confirm the coverage. She said that I should expect to receive a confirmation letter from the insurance company in two weeks but now four weeks has passed and I didn't receive a confirmation letter. Is it normal? I don't know whether there is something goes wrong. I check the blue shield website and it shows that the fee for the coverage for the oral evaluation and panoramic film has been approved. Does it mean that the coverage for extracting wisdom teeth is also approved?
I am currently low income and need dental implants. I am 40 and suffer from Lupus as well as many other medical conditions. My medications have caused severe dry mouth and in turn my teeth are going bad. I was told about you guys possibly doing low cost implants. I would like some info on prices please. Thank you for your time.
I did Invisalign through the graduate orthodontic clinic and was wondering about the possibility of refinements. I finished in 2017, I believe I started in 2016, and was told that there was a 5 year period for refinements.
I noticed that you are not allowing anyone to accompany a patient to a dental appointment.  How do you handle adult patients with limited or no English language ability?

Bioactive Restorative Treatment?  My name is Paul Ostrander and I'm a past patient of the Dental school and I recently was in the Clinic looking for treatment with the Bioactive Restorative treatment approach. I have a 4 Unit Bridge (12-13-14-15)with 15 having an issue with Carin resulting from a post perforation thru the tooth when I had the bridge installed while under my pastDental Group (Great Expressions) whom I've had undesirable experiences with.  While at the GraduateClinic checking into having a Bioactive Restorative Treatment plan using the Silver Diamine Fluoride and the Bioactive Restorative approach. I was seen first by what I think was the Student. and then a member of the Staff which then probed and dug into the area and pulled something out and I asked him was that Gutta-Percha? and he said yes, why would he open the area more to possible infection into the exposed root, it seemed as if he wanted me to have the whole bridge removed and go with implants. I told them that I really would like to try and save the bridge and it was a lot to lose and so much to gain by trying the Silver Diamine Fluoride and the Bioactive Restorative approach. Is this not something that the Dental School-is working with? I do want to tell you that I am also a past patient of the implant clinic which is where I have had 2 Molar implants done successfully and very happy with them! I did explain to them that I do not want implants for two reasons, one is that they will involve Sinus Lifts which at my age I feel is too risky because of going through Chronic Sinusitis and I do not want to lose the 4 Unit Bridge which is very solid. Do you think my case can be further researched and examined closer to see if this is truly a direction to move forward with to restore #15 and save the bridge?  Regards, Paul E.Ostrander 734-516-8992

I have some impacted wisdom teeth and one is pushing a back molar out of alignment, I have no insurance and I’m worried about costs I’m looking at for an extraction.
, my name is Andrew Parham, i am emailing u because 3 to 4 years ago i came in to the school and wanted my tooth examine. I came in the student told me they would fix it, they never told me what fix it mean. So they then took me upstairs to a another department, so now another dentist or student comes in and began to numb my mouth, im like ok why, but never questioned because they have overseers to watch and make sure everything is going smoothly, so when they got done, i asked were they thru, they said yes, now i don't have any feeling in my mouth, So i asked, what did you guys do, told me they pulled my tooth. Now, at this point im mad and upset cause i never agreed to them pulling my tooth and if i had known what there plan was as to fixing the problem of my tooth then i would have never let them do that. So after they pulled the tooth, we had a couple words, and i was very upset and wouldnt leave until they did something about my missing tooth, so after hours they gave me a mouth piece sort of retainer to have something to put there so i wont appear to be missing. NOW, since then i been trying to save up the money so i can get me a implant where my tooth is missing. I havent saved up enough to make this happen and its causing me deep stress to walk around with a missing tooth. I feel like it was the school error in not telling me in full what they plan was to fix it, and i need help on resolving this matter. I've been trying for a couple years now to try and find away to get this implant done but its been hard financially. I am emailing hoping that u can help in some way to try and correct the situation, for i want to be able to smile and talk with out covering my mouth or smiling with my mouth close. I really would appreciate if u can help me find a resolution to this problem, for sometime now it has cause me great embarrassment.

Hi! I'm writing to determine the cost of placing an implant and a crown for tooth #4 (upper right). I have DeltaDental insurance and I am a UMich grad student.
I have two Crowns in my back theath Never a problem, but one chipped and the Dentist replaced it -I immediately had issues putting any pressure on the tooth, so the dentist removed the new crown and "redid" a root cannel I had in that tooth  When he put the second crown on - again I felt discomfort - not really pain - but any pressure again on the tooth I can feel at the base of my gums When the Crown was off I did not have any gum pain or issue.  What do you think the problem could be ?

I went to a clinic and they said I need 11 teeth out. All the rest of my top teeth to have a fake set made, then some broken big teeth on the bottom. I suffer from terrible panic attacks and I had to go outside and breathe 3 times just doing the x-rays. The dentist said that some of my teeth need to be cut out and he’s not sure if he can do that. He said I need to go somewhere that I can be put to sleep. The problem is I have Medicaid insurance and I can’t find anybody who accepts it and will put me to sleep. He thought someone there could so he told me to text you. If you can help me please let me know. Thank you.   Lucinda Woodworth
What would the cost out of pocket be for dental implants, with Medicaid?
I am a 72 year old Caucasian male in very good health.  I have a Maryland bridge on my lower left jaw. Tooth 18, 19, 20 (I think).  It has been completely trouble free for many years. My dentist wants to remove and replace it because she thinks that there is a small cavity nearby. I have no other dental issues. I would like your opinion please.  Can you take a look at it ASAP?
I need my wisdom teeth extracted. I have Blue Cross through Medicaid and I already have X-Rays. Could I have an estimate please? Thank you
I think one of my wisdom teeth are coming in, but in general i need an appointment for some cavities I have, but seeing how these are more serious things should I do the $$$ dentist option at the school?

Hello - my husband will be needing an oral surgeon soon and several teeth extracted with implants to replace removed teeth. My guess is it will be very extensive, he has an appointment in March for a review with a local oral surgeon.  Would this be something that your graduating student program would be able and/or interested in handling there? Please let me know - Thanks!  Phone:  517-304-3957

I am a graduate student from the School of Public health. I went to the dental clinic once. I am currently based in Chicago due to the pandemic. I have been experiencing discomfort and mild pain in one of my teeth for a couple of days now (the pain comes and goes and I don't feel it all the time). I wondered if I should see a dentist ? If yes, how can I schedule an appointment? Thank you and best wishes, Sarah Rozenblum
For the three times I have been to the dental school, I received no treatment only oral examination amounted to $111 and X-Ray amounted to $133 . On 12/10/2020 I was admitted as an emergency case for painful tooth . X-ray was taken by the student .Professional dentists examined the tooth and the X-ray and the verdict was inconclusive diagnosis . I was scheduled for another appointment on 12/15/2020 hoping for a treatment .Instead I had all my teeth X-rayed  in addition to panoramic shot 23 X-Ray shootings were taken in less than half an hour. On 01/06/2021 I had an emergency session hoping again for treatment at least temporary (test filling) for  another tooth .Two doctors  and the assigned student examined the tooth and again no treatment manifested.A treatment plant was handed over to me with a price of $1466 .  This amount is an addition to the $244 payment with no treatment. Considering my age  Born 11/20/1948, and retired immigrant depending solely on my Iraqi pension ($1250 /month) and a little help from my son ,I am of the feeling that the dental school exploited my trust in them and over did the examination and the X-Ray for extracting money as much as possible. As I wish to continue cooperation with the school on my terms and  to keep the treatment plan as is but for a reduced price of $600 . If this not acceptable to you then I request the followings: 1- Handing over of all the X-ray pertinent to myself . 2- A comprehensive diagnostic report and treatment protocol. 3- A safety report asserting that the my exposure to  X-ray did not exceed the daily dose for my age. Best Regards  Wahab Al jewari

What is charge for replacement orthodontics retainers for the top and bottom set?
Hello, I've been referred by my dentist to get a root canal done on #18. I've been advised Meridian doesn't cover this, so I'm looking for more affordable options. I have x-rays I can forward for your evaluation. Can you please advise price and availability? I need the root canal and the follow up build up and crown, if that's also offered.  Kind regards, Justin
I recently had a consultation with Stephanie Kline to discuss a prosthetic ear. My insurance did not pay the claim (account #970078) for $213, stating that the provider does not participate within my network. In speaking with my insurance company today, I learned that the School of Dentistry, Dept of Oral & Maxillofacial Surgery can request a gap exception from Meritain. Can someone there send a request to fax #763-852-5057, Attn: Gap exception. Please state that there is not a participating provider in network within a 50 mile radius of our residence and therefore you are requesting an exception in order to get in network benefits. While this is not critical for this claim, it would be critical to have this exception so that we can proceed with plans for a prosthetic ear. I look forward to hearing back from you regarding the outcome. Thank you!
Do you accept medicaid? Thanks

How long is the wait for a student dentist?
I was wondering if I could have the orthodontic clinic manager contact me about my bill. I was told my total cost of my sons comprehensive treatment would be $4065.00. Our first payment plan contract was $1800 then the second contract I received the other day was $3000? My son's name is Cullen Caro.
I am in desperate need of full mouth upper and lower implants. My dentist does not feel dentures will work for me and says they will never fit properly because of my bite and mouth structure. I'm 36 years old with lots of missing teeth and the teeth I do have left are broken and decayed and very painful every single day. Orajel has become a everyday necessity to just get through the day without excruciating pain. I'm a RN who has fought cancer several times and unfortunately my teeth have paid for it. I'm to the point now I don't leave my house unless I absolutely have to and I'm sure glad to wear a mask at work since I work full time. Sorry for the long story but I'm looking for any help possible to get implants that I can afford or make payments on since they cost so much. I do have insurance as well, but even with dental insurance they seem to still cost a ton. So to get to the point is this something I could get done here at your teaching facility and what would it cost? I'm thinking the 4 implant per top and bottom teeth procedure is most cost efficient from my research. If this is a procedure that can be preformed how do I get signed up? If I could get this done my whole outlook on life and self-confidence would drastically improve, because I feel at this point there may not be help available for me and I just can't continue on like this. Any help or information would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time and patients.

My husband and I are new to Medicare and have a Priority Health Dental Ins. Plan.  However, even with that, our dentist has given him a cost of over $1000 for a root canal and crown on one of his bottom teeth.

How does the cost and insurance then work?  Thank you!

Good morning.  I live in the Kalamazoo area and see a neurologist for my autoimmune disease at UofM. I’m very happy with the care they’ve provided me over the years. The time has come for full upper and lower dentures and wonder if you accept new patients. I have 13 teeth left that need to be pulled (5 upper 8 lower) some broken off at the gum line. I have Delta dental insurance through MESSA but it’s not that good.  If you are accepting new patients, I wonder if I could get some typical options for what could be offered to me. I’m not seeking the cheap way out but can’t afford a full set of implants either.  Thank you for your time and look forward to hearing from you.    Respectfully, Clark Osborn.   (269) 501-6726 cell

Hello, I am seeking dental care for my daughter, who is 5 years old and is requiring a crown on on her J tooth and has 6 teeth that are requiring resin composite. Based on her reaction to dental care (she currently has an extracted tooth and a spacer placed) her dentist is not comfortable completing the procedures in the office as he is wanting a more advanced option for sedation. I am seeking other options (besides an OR) due to being cash pay. Does your facility offer sedation options as "laughing gas" was not enough to help her to calm down and allow the necessary work to be done.  I look forward to hearing any options available.

General cost for root canal+crown for molars? My dentist sent a referral about a month back for 3 possible root canals. I live in South bend Indiana and can't afford to do a lot of traveling due to children, so it would be nice to have a rough estimate before proceeding with an appointment.  Thank you. Sorry as well.
Ball Park how much will upper full implants cost
What is the process to become a patient that only needs a bridge?
Hello, I am a patient at your clinic. Couple of weeks back, I came to your clinic with a problem. The doctor provided me with a prescription and told me that your root canal department will contact me to schedule my next appointments. It has been more than 2 weeks and my medication is over. I have not received any call/mail about that. Can you please help to find what is the problem on that front? Thanks in advance.
I have a tooth that is absolutely throbbing me and my dentist office told me two weeks before they can pull it out I’m trying to see if I can get in somewhere sooner.
I'm wondering if you take patients that are mid-treatment from another orthodontist?  My daughter has a HERBST appliance and brackets on six top teeth.  The recommended second phase of her treatment (brackets on all teeth and bands) came back with a very high quote.  I'm interested in getting information from other offices, but want to be sure you'll consider a mid-treatment patient first.  Thank you!
Hello, I'm assisting a client who has been referred to UM dental school by a few local clinics due to his need for dental implants after full dental extraction for the purposes of getting dentures. He is in significant pain that has been ongoing for 5-10 years. Do you offer this service and at what cost? How may I assist this client in scheduling an appointment with the dental surgical clinic? Thank you.
I have a referral from my dentist for 2 extractions but the oral surgeon he referred me to cant see me until mid-June. I have limited dental insurance so I will bear most of the cost. I also will need a total of 5 implants. I am trying to get a ballpark price just so I know what to expect. Thank you in advance.
I’m currently a patient in U-M Dentistry but I’ll be leaving the country soon as I’m an international student and I’m graduating this semester. How do I request a copy of my dental records so that I can continue to receive treatment elsewhere?
Sadly, I have neglected my teeth for far too long.  Now I need Prosthodontics and Restorative work.  I don't know where to start.  I am missing teeth in the front, which I've been wearing a mouthpiece (partial) to hide and I've been wearing it way too long.  It is causing deterioration of all of my teeth. I do have insurance, but I suspect, to get done what I feel is even minimally necessary, it will be costly.  I want to make sure that you will take the insurance, if and how payment plans work and I also need to know where to start. Thank you.
I wanted to have a root canal from institute's Graduate Specialty Clinics. I wanted to know how much fee would be waived off by the insurance, what percentage!
How to I get my patient information forwarded to another dentist?
Hi! Could you help me to check if I have paid my billing successfully? I had $186.6 balance on my account before, I paid on April 8 online but didn't receive any email. I want to make sure I have paid that before I graduate this semester, my date of birth is 06/16/1997, thank you!

Hello There,  Thank you for spending time on my letter. I had my dental filling in your clinic in 2017 and I live in Nashville, TN now. Unfortunately, one filling (on #14 tooth) fell out when I was having lunch today and I ate it. Subsequently, a part of the same tooth (about 1/4 of one tooth, vertically) fell out when I tried to clean that area using a dental floss (gentle clean, no pain). Now, I not only lost one filling, but also lost 1/4 of a tooth.   I have the X-ray images of that tooth before and after filling (I believe you also have my record), and I save the falling-out part of that tooth as well. I can send these information to you if needed.  My question is: 1, what shall I do about this issue? 2, what kind of help or compensation you can provide for this?   Best Regards,  Peifu Cheng TEL: 9062313419
I need 2 crowns. My one tooth, the cusp just broke off. I have healthy MI plan, Molina. I'm looking for an estimate. Much will 1 crown cost?
I have been given a quote of $10k to fix my teeth. (broken, missing crown etc.) How would I know if this is something that would work for me at your clinic? I have held off on fixing these issues due to the cost.
I have Oral Surgery on May 14th but was not given a time. Where can I find this information?
Dear Faculty at University of Michigan,  I am looking for an experienced professor who can provide a long distance dental consultation, paid in advance. I live in Thailand and am faced with a great life challenge. I can travel if necessary. I've been in continuous pain for 13 months. This pain was triggered by a root canal treatment. I've had four more root canal treatments (RCTs), the last two were done by a professor from a top Thai university.  Background: Tooth #26 was accidentally cracked at a local discount clinic, while changing an old filling, here in Thailand. The result was pain (2-4) only when eating. One year later the clinic did an RCT. After the RCT the pain when eating was gone, however I have been in continuous pain since this first RCT. Four more RCTs were done by different endodontists. Calcium hydroxide has been in the tooth since then, except for a three week period when an antibiotic was placed instead (during the fourth RCT). I have two CBCT scans, two CT scans, and several X-rays. There is a 2.5 cm cyst in the maxillary sinus, right above tooth #26. ENT doctors doubt the pain is caused by the cyst and don't advise removing the cyst. Removing the cyst with an endoscopic surgery would require cutting a bone and raising the lacrimal duct, with a small possibility that this kind of surgery would increase the nasality of my voice. The pain feels inside the tooth, not the sinus.  Symptoms: Tooth #26 hurts continuously - ranging from 1 to 4 on a pain index scale of 1-10. The average pain has been 2.5, but has diminished in the last month to 1.5. Most of the time the pain is greater when I press the tooth with my tongue or thumb, vertically or sideways. Recently I discovered that when I lie down on a bed face up, and bang my head backwards against a pillow I feel a sharp strong pain in the tooth. Also, the pain appears to get worse when I sing sometimes. Before the fourth root canal was done, I sometimes felt greater pain for a few seconds upon chewing extremely hot food, such as microwaved food. I recently discovered that very hot water increases the pain in the tooth. Please help, I hope to get expert advice on this case.   Best regards, Marco Monti

Have a gap where my perio tried 3 times to generate bone.  My dentist wants now to put a permanent bridge.

Anyone anywhere?  Thanks!!

I'm inquiring about the general costs of invisalign.

I just need a reprint of an antibiotic script te emergency clinic wrote flor me a short time ago - no one wants to reprint this - and per usual it seems different departments are blaming each other despite existing in the same building.

I have a couple of very painful broken back teeth, one of which is highly infected, and was referred for surgery by Hillsdale Dental Clinic. I was denied an appointment based on having a "balance" with U of M, but when I contacted billing, they said that I don't owe anything. Is there a way someone could contact me about this? I really need dental assistance, it took months to even get the call back in the first place, but to be told there's a "balance" that needs to be paid but billing telling me this is untrue? I really don't know what to do to handle this. Thank you.
Hello, I have a very poor Dental plan provided by my employer and I believe I need some sort of oral surgery to repair several teeth. I was wondering if their are any more affordable options available as I cannot afford to go to a typical Dentist office to have this work preformed.
My jaw was hurting so I went to the dentist he said my back molar was cracked so it needed pulled. He pulled it and told me I had TMJ. That was in September of 2020. Almost every day since then I’ve had a headache, turned into migraine. Had Botox for migraines, nerve blocks in my neck, physical therapy, nothing is helping. I’ve been to two other dentists since then who said the tooth didn’t need to be pulled.  Now my problem is I have to eat everything on the left side of my mouth. When he pulled that molar the tooth on front of that shifted and now my bite is off. When I close my mouth I can only feel that side of my teeth click and I feel that that is also causing a lot of my headaches. I could go on and on but would be easier in person.  I live in toledo and have Medicare and Medicaid. Can’t find a dentist to help me that I can afford. I need an implant and heard Botox could help also. My daughter is in dental school also but at LSU, a little too far for me to travel so she told me to contact you. Please help me. I’ve had a head every day since September and can’t take the them anymore. Thank you.
Would like to get an appointment and find out about the charges for those who do not have the dental insurance.
rate sheet for regular dentistry - I live in Toledo and will drive up for regular cleanings etc

I have TMJ caused by an autoimmune arthritis (called ankylosing spondylitis) that is effected my jaw, in a similar way to what RA does. Does your office treat patients with TMJ-linked to RA/arthritis? Also, I think I might need to get some other procedures done, and am worried that said TMJ might get in the way because this is a pretty bad flare, would you be able to help me regardless? If not, where should I go?
Do you have any assistance for low income patients? I lost my 4 front teeth and have a very low income from Social Security disability. Without assistance, I cannot afford the recommended implants.

More information on dental implants
Do you remove wisdom teeth? I was referred to get mine removed at another office, but they did not accept my insurance. If you do, how much is it and do I need insurance or not?
I don't know who or how to properly reach out to regarding the problems I have been having post-surgery. A tooth may not have been fully extracted.  I have had problems gaining access to the oral surgery department, from the beginning. Navigating the front desk has been a major stumbling block. Even though I was given two referrals, by University of Michigan doctors, I was told by the woman at the front desk/receptionist/screener that in spite having the referrals and already having gone to another dental school and having full sets of X-rays, proper cleaning etc., I still had to start the process to get into that department by going to the University of Michigan dental school. Despite the pain and other complications I scheduled a later appointment as directed. The dental school was only able to review my records and tell me that I needed to go to a different department for treatment. I had to reschedule back to the dental surgery department and had to wait again before I could come back. Then when I arrived on my second visit, I quickly learned that I was scheduled with the wrong department and told I would have to reschedule and wait again. Finally, I got into the oral surgery department, the one I tried to get into many weeks earlier.  I don't know who or how to properly reach out to regarding the problems I have been having post-surgery. A tooth may not have been fully extracted. So I was finally going to get the tooth pulled. The woman at the front desk who sounded like the woman who originally directed me away in my original attempt to schedule an appointment, told me, in front of and in earshot of the people waiting behind me and a couple others sitting nearby, that I had an outstanding bill and that she would not let me go back for the scheduled procedure unless I first paid my outstanding balance, in full. I questioned what she was talking about since I had never been to this office. I had to explain that I am a cancer patient who is immune compromised. I have had three bone marrow stem-cell transplants. I explained again that I had an abscess and my condition was considered urgent if not an emergency. All she would say was I had to pay all the outstanding balance or she would not let me go back. I was completely befuddled and I did not know what to do or who to turn to. I tried explaining that between my insurance and copays I have brought millions of dollars to the UofM and that and “unpaid” bills were a result of  having been miscoded or my secondary insurances having not been billed properly. I explained that my wife, because of my medical conditions, is the one who handles the bills is the one who might be able to better explain where things stand but she was not permitted to come into the building and is sitting out in the car. I explained that I was willing to pay any necessary fees that are required to have the procedures done at that time but she kept saying that I had to pay the outstanding bills before she would let me through even though I told her this procedure was considered an emergency.   Only when I began to turn to leave did she finally say she would let me through if I paid for the services being rendered on that day. After the procedure of pulling the tooth I was told the tooth root was atypical, and the shape was not what was normal for that tooth, apparently lacking one or more of the root structures. I was told this would take several weeks to fully heal. I was told that I did not need a follow-up visit and I didn't need an antibiotic.   In the weeks and months since, I have had drainage, hard bony pieces of material come to the surface and eventually fall out from the area  where the tooth was extracted.  In my recent visit to another office to have my teeth cleaned I explained my ongoing troubles and I was told that it appeared that something did not look right and possibly a part of the tooth that was supposed to be extracted might have been overlooked and left behind in the socket. They only do cleaning and told me that they do not do the more advanced procedures that might be needed.   In the time since the extraction, I have had some healing and at times the bleeding and pain will begin to improve but those periods of time have been few. I am still having drainage, inflammation, and pain in that area. My eye on that side of my face is still inflamed.   I don't know what to do. Again, I am a cancer patient with a compromised immune system. Infections can be deadly for me. I don't know who to turn to, I have paid for the services of having this tooth pulled but now it looks like I will need to return to have the rest of the tooth extracted if there is something there and have the previous procedure completed.   I don't have the money to keep making hours long trips to Ann Arbor for appointments that are unnecessary and/or only be told I will not be permitted to have a serious condition dealt with because of some unrelated bill that might be stuck in the billing process.   During my last doctor's visit at the medical center, I raised this issue and the problems I have been having. The software used by the dental care areas does not communicate with the larger system at the medical center so they could not see my records or tell me who to contact but they did recommend that I try what I am doing now.    Please, can someone with a higher level medical license - not a receptionist, please call me back and help me get through this process. I am just tired of fighting the red tape. I don't know how or why someone, a receptionist, can control so much of my care, force me to jump through so many unnecessary hoops, and also, under HIPAA, have so much access to my records outside of what is directly under the umbrella of that department.    My name is Robert Christenson. My number is 810 397-8756. My wife's name is Tina and her number is 810 397-8755.   Please have someone call me who can help, this has been going on for way too long

Hello, I am a postdoc of UM participating in Delta PPO plan. I would like to appoint a root canal therapy and have a crown. How can I choose the doctor? do all the faculty in Dental Faculty Associates accept the Delta PPO plan, or only selected doctors accept this plan? Thanks
On 4/13 I asked about becoming a patient. After having my records from UofD sent over (as asked) I called the number given about getting an appointment. The person who makes the appointments was in a meeting. When they did not get back to me I called again on 4/16. I was told someone would call in 2 to3 weeks and I would probably have to wait until June or July. No problem. When no one called back after 3 weeks I was told they were busy. But they would give the info to the clinic...And here we are 5/20
I need to have 2 root canals done, I am in pain 24/7 and have stopped eating solid foods from it. Every place I have spoken with prices me at $3000+ it would be tooth 18/19 Codes D3330/D2950/D2740A I was suggested to reach out to U of M to see if this may be a better option financially speaking I have 2 insurances (Principle and Meridian/Medicaid) Is this going to be about the same cost as everywhere else or do you offer payment plans? I have about $1250 saved and have a gofundme (literally only other option as I can not get the CareCredit)
I work at Advanced Oral Surgery in Grand Rapids, MI and we have referred patients over to you for cysts, biopsies etc..  I have a patient with Medicaid who says that if we refer him to U of M for a full arch restoration, that you can do it and accept his Medicaid, therefor not costing them anything...  I highly doubt this is a procedure that Medicaid would cover, but he does have some health concerns.  We do not accept or even bill out to state programs, but we did see this patient and his caregiver for a complimentary consult for the All on 4 procedure.  What is your opinion on this?  I would hate to waste your time or the patient's by sending them to you, but they are "positive" you can do the procedure.  I wanted to reach out to someone about this before I appeased the patient.  Thank you SO much for your time!  Katie Hawkins, OM at Advanced Oral Surgery
My son has MI-Child insurance and ended up having to have a root canal. Apparently his insurance doesn't cover the crown and is going to cost me over $1000 out of pocket. U of M was recommended to me. Can I please get information about your cost?  Thank you!
Good afternoon.  I am interested in speaking with a representative about your jail dentistry program.  Thank you!
A lower left-side premolar of mine broke off a significant chunk. I am not certain but believe I had a crown on that one previously, potentially a root canal. The pain is minimal to non-existent. I’d like to get it fixed please. I do not have dental coverage but of course will pay out of pocket.
How do I find out if there’s dental insurance on my insurance
How do I get someone to return my phone call after leaving voicemails?
Doing some research I found a 1965 article about an electronic transmitter built into a tooth apparently by someone at your school. https://archive.macleans.ca/article/1965/9/18/broadcasting-your-bite The only other place I found this is in the 1966 Encyclopedia Britannica Book of the Year. https://www.eevblog.com/forum/chat/crazy-1960s-radio-transmitters/?action=dlattach;attach=1222211;image  It's an electronics marvel if it was built in 1965. Maybe it's in a box in your basement.   I was wondering if there's any way to verify that this actually happened.

Who should I contact to discuss alternatives to a Maryland bridge on my front right incisor, which recently failed. It failed after 30 years.  Likewise two re-glue attempts have failed in the last three months.  And the third re-glue attempt is failing.    I would be open to be part of a research study.  Tried an implant about 10 years ago.  However, that failed.  I originally lost the tooth taking an elbow to the mouth playing on the church softball team.  Thank you. Carl Degen. 269-323-2049

I have X-linked hypophosphatemia an extremely rare genetic condition that causes renal wasting of phosphorus. As a result of the disease bone formation (including teeth) is poor and cause spontaneous abscesses and infections. I’m at a point where I need permanent dentures. (regular dentures are not an option due to chronic dry mouth). Does the UM dental school offer discounted care for treatment of a rare condition which could be useful for instructive purposes? The treatment should be covered by my medical insurance under provisions for genetic anomaly.

I was a patient at UofM for my braces (roughly 10 years ago), and received my retainers from you. I've recently broken my retainer, and was wondering what the cost of getting a new one would be? It was my bottom teeth wire that's broken. What's the cost of replacing my bottom retainer? Would it be cheaper to get a new set all together? Would I have to come in for a new fitting? Could this be covered by insurance? I understand that it seems odd to ask for new retainers as it has been 10 years since having braces, but my teeth do shift even if I don't wear them for a few days.

How much is a root canal for a tooth
Hi, I would like to send my dental records to the dental student clinic. How may I do so? The website doesn't mention this anywhere. Thank you!
When trying to book an appointment for some work that I really need to have done, I have been told that because I missed an appointment over two years ago, I cannot book an appointment. At that time I urgently needed a root canal and another clinic could get me in faster. This was a very time sensitive issue and I must have forgotten to cancel. Is there a process that I can go through to appeal this? I would understand if there had been a recent missed appointment, but due to a missed appointment over two years ago is a bit much. Not to mention, no one informed me about this policy or that missing the appt two years ago would result in my being unable to book future appointments. I am a student living on campus and would not be able to get a cost-effective dentist otherwise. This is directly preventing my ability to access care, which is extremely concerning.

I was wondering if before I made my appointment I could have my previous dentist send over my x rays?
Before I moved from Ann Arbor, Dr. Oh offered me 30% discount on my new partial plate, possibly because I would not be there for follow-up care on it.  Since I had already paid for the work, this discount will have to take the form of a refund on my Visa card.  I believe the plate total cost was $2710, such that the rebate would come to $813, which so far I have not seen on my Visa account.  Please let me know when it will be available.  See Dr. Oh's notes for verification.
My fiancée has been in need of dental work that she cannot afford for a very long time, in recent years she has started getting done what she can, unfortunately due to her insurance cap and the pandemic the work hasn't been done and she is losing teeth that could have formally been saved.  She would need many extractions as well as some implants.  Is this something that can be arranged in a timely manner through UofM?  I believe she's called quite a while ago and left a message with no reply.  Any information you can give me on this process will be appreciated as I feel this has become an emergency with her getting pain radiating through half her face/ear.

My boyfriend has to have a full mouth extraction and dentures. Since he's only 28, and a vocal artist, he wanted a more natural looking and "permanent" solution, so we fell in love with "snap in" or "mini implant" dentures. The last quotes we got cost more than our home, so I was hoping to see if you even did snap in dentures and if so if we are able to make an appointment for a consultation.

Hello, would like to inquire about a very complex treatment: bicuspid extraction reversal ortho treatment with implants (hope I spelled it correctly.) I had extraction orthodontics treatment at age 17, from then to now I do notice my teeth are squished in, I have tmj, my ears click, sleep apnea and my snoring has affected the sleep of my partners. I am now 40 and am seeking treatment to improve my quality of life. Please let me know if you would like to take a stab at my case or perhaps refer me to the right direction. I thank you for your consideration of my inquiry Thank You, Anna
My son is 14 years old and has SPD, ASD and CI.  He needs extensive dental work done but we are struggling with finding a dentist that works with special needs patients.  We have been to consults for IV sedation but we would have to pay nearly $5k out of pocket because dental ins won’t cover this and we are getting super discouraged because our son needs a tooth pulled and cavities filled but he needs special accommodations.  Can you help?
