I don't have any experience with crowns yet and learned a bit about electro-surge and crown margin repair and am looking forward to doing that with possibly Dr. Migdal.

2021-03-26 08:39:34	R_20TlWrgXG7jsz6u	I think today's appointment went well overall. I am starting to feel more confident about identifying and being able to determine which patients I am capable of treating vs. which patients I need to refer to a specialist.

2021-02-02 03:12:53	R_21yLVZev4wrAgMu	I think today's appointment went well overall. One thing that I learned today was that you can actually prep/restore a tooth without using anesthetics if the caries is shallow enough! I was afraid at first because it was my first time drilling without giving my pt anesthetics so it was really cool for Dr. Miller to show me that it works at first before letting me do it on my own.

2021-01-29 07:03:20	R_25QQueK25z3XKhg	I think today's appointment went well overall. However, there were a couple things that I could improve on.

I believe this mindset may have led me to over-diagnosing caries in areas with deep, stained pits and fissures.

I also plan to use rolled gauze to temporarily displace gingiva and gain better access to sites, along with verifying these sites are clean with a perio probe (versus an explorer alone).

Additionally, I do think it would be ideal to extract #1 as it is supra erupted and has no opposing tooth, so I plan to email the ortho resident to inform her of the small cavity that we found beginning under the mesial contact of this tooth. It is always nice working with you!	D3	improvement	Exam/Tx Plan
2021-03-23 00:35:20	R_1HkM0TAw57tsqzy	This procedure went very efficiently and I really appreciated Dr. Walcotts insight into the etiology of the mobility on #6. I instructed the patient to try to wear her RPD when she is chewing to decrease the forces on this tooth. The only thing I would do differently is at the beginning I was having some issues with the chair, now I know to to hit the power surge on the outlet to get it to work rather than calling chair repair.

2021-03-25 17:51:03	R_1JJSV0TOuoA7j6Z	I thought this appointment went very well. I really appreciated Dr. Padburys insight into the questionable lesion around the root apecies of #30. This was something that I was unsure about and my mom was a bit concerned regarding but I feel the way he presented it helped to kind of ease my moms concerns. I did follow up with Dr. Soki and she feels that it may be something like focal cemental Osseous dysplasia or idiopathic osteosclerosis. Nothing to be imminently concerned regarding.

Overall, I think it went really well and I appreciated Dr. Yus help with the case and the perio records. The only thing that I wish I could do better is to identify calculus subgingivally. It is not difficult to identify larger spots of calculus, but the smaller ones I find very difficult to determine.	D3	improvement	Periodontics
2021-04-02 13:58:32	R_1KrqYWjuYJtjrXL	This procedure went really well in the end and I am very happy with the end result for the patient.

2021-01-27 13:47:23	R_20UQ7E46O9lhFMd	This procedure went very efficiently because it was just an updated exam and cleaning on my fiance as my patient (who already has exceptional oral health) so it is very difficult for me to find anything that I would do differently.

2021-03-25 17:35:04	R_24cqUHoPx9OKhEw	I was initially a bit nervous about this procedure because I have never done dental treatment on a blind patient and his needs were extensive.

I worked with you to do an onlay prep on #30.

2021-04-05 21:16:09	R_1dAB37BW6MGnrgZ	This was my first crown, and I was a bit nervous and took too long with a prep that was too conservative. I need to work on efficiency to finish my prep on time. Also would like to try PMMA instead of integrity next time, it was hard to work with integrity as it was very flimsy and easily chipped off margin.	D3	improvement	Prosthodontics
2021-02-20 22:07:11	R_1jWi1fXDM5pWrK7	I would like to be more confident when finishing margins subgingivally, and to try using the same technique with the flat plastic hand instrument to restore the subgingival composite instead of packing a cord. The cord did in the end get in the way more than it helped. 	D3	improvement	Restorative
2021-04-02 02:48:51	R_1kGJleWzPf5ts9v	It was a very new experience to me to navigate the appointment while the patient had earphones in. There were a couple times I needed to talk to her and have her take them out. I think this could have caused some stress for her.

2021-04-05 14:34:56	R_1JQj7SnijBEDmk6	My initial prep was underextended, requiring additional tooth structure removal in order to obtain a clean DEJ both within the proximal box and distal pit. Furthermore, next time I will widen the isthmus to allow for access with the composite tip, and widen the dovetail bucco-lingually to ensure complete caries removal.	D3	improvement	Restorative
2021-02-04 14:30:46	R_1LzJTTEWnQcOzJI	Everything went smoothly for this exam and prophy. The pt. had no carious lesions and shows impressive home care, which allows us to observe, rather than treat, any of her potential restorative needs.	D3	improvement	Exam/Tx Plan
2021-04-18 13:04:35	R_1n6FocbVQvXyPbi	My restoration was bulky along the distal margin. Dr. Guram gave me the tip of viewing the restoration from occlusal and shaping it such that it follows the long axis of the tooth and the natural constricture towards the CEJ. This will prevent any damage to the periodontal tissues from the restoration being over-contoured.	D3	improvement	Restorative

2021-03-04 01:10:17	R_26aP4XNq0HJ7nnh	I would like to really check my prep. I feel like the ledge of tooth structure between the two layers of amalgam is going to bite me in the butt. Maybe the two areas of amalgam should have touched on the floor of the prep, but I was given the go ahead to restore and I hope it stays stable and doesn't fracture or later. That's what the crown is for, I suppose.	D3	improvement	Prosthodontics
2021-03-04 01:10:17	R_26aP4XNq0HJ7nnh	So it will be okay that at the bottom/center of the prep there will be areas of amalgam? Because we made a core, so we will only remove the outside of the structure and create a nice margin (in part because we marked it with amalgam). The core does not need to all be one material?

2021-03-10 21:28:06	R_DqtoTtwCBMUzrm9	I think this went really well, I really enjoyed discussing possible treatment plan options during the appointment with Dr. Geetha. The only complication I faced was that I was not sure what the most appropriate way to address that the patient should avoid using treatment options such as the smile direct club to solve her malocclusion. I knew from the moment that she said it that it was a bad idea, but since she came in very excited about it, I didn't know how to tell her that it was not the right move. 	D3	improvement	Exam/Tx Plan

My patient had a root canal done on a bi-rooted premolar (#13). When I placed the core, the faculty member helped me place a pre-fab post into the premolar. It most likely perforated the root.

Next time, I would like to be more confident in my ability and prep thoroughly while working efficiently.

2021-02-20 21:52:03	R_3RvDnBmIN2zk8Og	In terms of something to be mindful of for future appointments and my career in dentistry is managing the time available/scheduled for an appointment from the minute the appointment begins.

I need to refresh the individual steps for RPD fabrication for her next appointment since it's been a while and I was confusing some of the details as I was explaining to her about her upcoming appointments for RPD fabrication.

2020-11-25 09:03:22	R_0IjN2pzR34PQckp	I had a D5650A RPD delivery today and one thing that I learned was checking for balanced occlusion. Tooth #6 was added to an existing upper RPD and when checking for occlusion, my focus was only on tooth #6. I had the pt bite down and adjust until he said he didn't feel like his bite wasn't high anymore like you would do with a restoration but this was not how you check for occlusion when doing dentures. It was my first denture experience and I learned and will grow from this experience!	D3	improvement	Prosthodontics
2020-09-08 16:43:57	R_1CemEPYJaMkvwI1	First day back as the provider, I think I did some things out of order and forgot to do a caries risk assessment as well. Some things came back to me quickly while others did not and I think that they will gradually come back as I get used to being in clinic and seeing pts more. Next time, I want to be more prepared before my appt so I go into it knowing exactly what I have to do and in what order.	D3	improvement	Exam/Tx Plan
2020-11-13 02:59:09	R_1FaAdJYHUkKn9BL	I've had little to no exposure with dentures so far so today was a good learning experience. I learned how to do a pick up impression, writing/sending a lab form, and dealing with dental stores/front desk people with lab fees. It was a lot of new information/experience all at once but now that I've done it once, I believe that next time, things will go a lot smoother and easier for me.	D3	improvement	Prosthodontics
2020-09-18 20:57:11	R_1FIY8d3IwcTJSmR	I thought today's appointment went well overall. One thing that I think I could do better next time to prepare would be to review some information about dentures before my appointment.

2020-11-04 04:42:44	R_1hyUgBXPg3n6NdT	I think today's procedure went well overall. One thing that I did miss was detecting a couple caries on root surfaces and the distal of a premolar. My examination of occlusal and facial caries are definitely improving, but I still need to work on detecting mesial/distal and lingual caries. I will definitely try to focus on this area and do a better job for my next patient.	D3	improvement	Restorative
2020-10-09 03:13:02	R_1JCsYSrgjYlcpoC	"One thing that I learned and would like to do differently next time would be to integrate the clinical exam with the radiographs. I found myself relying and focusing too much on the xrays rather than looking at the teeth clinically and it really hit me when Dr. Miller said ""I don't trust radiographs."" Yes, they are a great tool to have and they allow us to see stuff that we can't see with our naked eyes, but I think I need to develop and trust my eyes more if I want to improve as a dental provider."

I have a follow-up question about the patient encounter: When I applied the topical anesthetic the patient had a very bad panic attack, and she said that part of it is that the feeling of numbness is very triggering for her due to her past medical experiences with her legs, but she also said that it caused a jolt of sharp pain.

I felt some roughness on the lingual area of the restoration and I was considering adding more material to smoothen it out, but then faculty showed me how to smooth it with only a bur. I think I am being too careful when using a handpiece, and I think I should be a little more aggressive to provide better surface texture. 	D3	improvement	Restorative

Patiend kept saying pain when my explorer touched the mesial portion of the #19 crown prep where there was an old filling. I am not sure if that is because the old filing is close to the pulp or other reasons. His left IAN should be anesthetized and he should not feel anything on the tooth. Still confusing to me.

For some reasons, they did not take the pan. We can potentially miss some important diagnostic information without it. I will try to add it when next exam is due. 	D3	improvement	Exam/Tx Plan

When I made the temporary crown, I had a chance to check the thickness of occlusal reduction and it turned out my distal lingual cusp was not reduced enough.

2021-03-03 18:22:36	R_yWSZgLm5teQ20dr	The prophy went well. Ensured pt that her old restorations are still intact and I will observe them.

But when I etched and air dried patient's cavity, she felt intense pain. The anesthesia that I gave in the first session worn off.

But the downside is esthetic. Dr. Zamler suggested me to do a bevel to blend the shade, which definitely helped. If time allows, another way that I can try is the layer technique that matches dentin and enamel shade separately. 	D3	improvement	Restorative

2020-10-03 00:28:52	R_1gcMhsu2Gcbd2Fu	Pt's gum is inflamed and he is overdue for cleaning. I would probably have referred him to have his teeth cleaned before I treated his decay, which will make my class II prep and filling a lot easier since the interdental papilla is swelling and blocks my access and vision. Also, I would have been more conservative in terms of determining which teeth need to be restored. We can watch incipient lesions and can always intervene if they progress over time. They may stop with OHI and preventive measures. 	D3	improvement	Restorative
2020-09-22 00:27:58	R_1jBw8sVvxD2lSpm	With Dr. Zamler's help, I restored three teeth including #11DL, #12DO, and #13DO. When I prepared #13DO,  Dr. Zamler suggested me to use sandy strips or ContacEZ polishing strips to smooth #14M as I will never have a chance to smooth the mesial side of #14. It was a little bit hard for me to use soft sandy strips, but the ContacEZ worked well. I would probably start to use this tool in the future. 	D3	improvement	Restorative

Additionally, I reinforced the importance of oral hygiene so hopefully there is improvement at the 4-6 week re-evaluation.

2020-11-23 16:14:05	R_28zKayzrhqEQYFa	I was a little worried prior to this appointment because it was my first crown prep and I have heard that #15 is difficult to access. However I feel like this went really well, I just wish that I could have been more efficient with my time to get more done quicker. I think if I could change one thing I would have been more aggressive with my reduction from the beginning because I know I was too conservative initially and just ended up wasting some time.

Initially, I was having difficulty getting the garrison fully adapted to the distolingual cervical area of the box, but eventually I was able to get a really good adaptation. I was worried about the contact being difficult to obtain because the contact of the adjacent tooth #19M was quite flat from a previous restoration.

There were recurrent caries on the mesial and the distal. I think I was overall prepared for the treatment.

Starting with the fine long tapered crown prep bur to drop my boxes, using the narrow inter-proximal bur to smooth out my walls, and switching to the finishing bur that only cuts on the end to smooth out the floors of my prep. I am really looking forward to my 	D3	improvement	Restorative
2020-12-09 18:28:53	R_3h5rb1vCZ5ok7uG	Today, I took final impressions for a crown. Dr. George helped me write the lab slip to reflect what I want to see delivered for my patient.

2020-12-07 15:48:31	R_3iX1Fu7TYWBchuw	Today I did my first crown prep. It was definitely challenging since the patient had difficulty staying open, so it was an adjustment doing the prep on a real patient. Dr. Krezel taught me a really great technique for making a temp using a pre fab crown and PMMA. It was awesome to watch him do it, so now I know what to do next time! Happy I got to learn a new method of fabricating a long lasting temp today! 	D3	improvement	Prosthodontics
2020-10-20 14:51:04	R_3LbRYJPsv6gN19p	I am really disappointed with how the cervical margin of my restoration turned out. I wedged before filling when there wasn't really room to and this resulted in a poor contour on the cervical of my restoration. In general, access was a struggle for me during this restoration. Next time, I would restore the facial first before restoring the lingual which I think would improve the overall quality of my restoration. This was a challenging restoration for me, but a good learning experience. 	D3	improvement	Restorative
2020-09-28 12:40:15	R_3ludfBQGk90lsFF	Next time, I would like to have a better idea of how to sequence prosthodontic treatment with the other dental disciplines. My patient was considering ortho, but also needs a tooth extracted and an implant. Dr. Kolling made the excellent point that the patient needs all his ortho done before he gets the implant placed. Now, I have a better idea of what order treatment needs to be performed in, so I can help my patient make decisions about which specialty to contact first for care. 	D3	improvement	Prosthodontics

The crown prep seems to get more difficult each time we need to re-prep the tooth so I am a little worried about where to go next.

The periodontal maintenance went well. However, Dr. Oh was able to grab calculus I missed on the distal of 18 which I assume was subgingival. Besides that,	D3	improvement	Periodontics

2020-10-16 13:28:46	R_Y4v2PCqiLvJzeM1	This procedure went incredibly well, the only element which I would change is my injection method. During the middle of the appointment the patient became sensitive to the cold air and water. I think if I would have been a little better at the injection, or perhaps if I had gone more toward the apex of #3 instead of over #2 and #4 for the MSA/PSA this would have been more effective. I will try that for next time.	D3	improvement	Restorative
2020-09-26 21:34:14	R_zfifHBJGoFl3Jvz	The procedure went very well, the only element I would change would have been to try to take the patient downstairs to have her radiographs taken because it ended up being after the appointment was supposed to be done when I actually was able to get in.

The caries was right at the gum line and the adjacent tooth (#13) has a large fracture so it was difficult to build up this contour on this part of the tooth.

I had a difficult time moving the gingiva/rubber dam away from the margin in order to adequately wrap a tofflemire band around the tooth. If I was to be faced with this situation again, I would do exactly what you did - place my finger on the band while simultaneously pushing the wedge through the embrasure space in order to seal the margin.

An area of improvement would be to know when a slot prep or a full class 2 prep should be done (extending to the occlusal) I have heard differing opinions, some say slot prep has a greater failure rate, while occlusal extension while more retentive is also more invasive."	D3	improvement	Restorative

Ideally, caries removal, core buildup (if needed), impressions, and temporary would all be completed in one appointment.

I later realized when I got home that I was confused about it because when I usually do a sedative filling, it's when I'm going to prep and fill a tooth but then we realize that we should change our treatment and put in the sedative filling instead of a composite (so now I get where my confusion came from).

Thank you for your help Dr. Zamler! It was insightful to hear the reasoning for tx planning for a crown rather than a DO resto for a tooth that would loose structural integrity over time.
