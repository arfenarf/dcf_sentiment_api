I did get anxious when I lost my floor when I was doing caries removal but this was a good learning experience for me on what to do when caries go onto the root surface in the future. One thing I struggle with is wanting to maintain being conservative but being able to open the prep up enough to be able to visualize caries removal. This is something I want to work on and be able to more independently apply clinical decision making in the future!,One thing I have been struggling with is just being able to see in general when prepping anything thats not a straight forward direct filling. In this example when I was prepping the distal part I really felt like I had to rely a lot on feel and take my time to look in my mirror then drill a little and check back and forth. It does make me more nervous to not be able to directly see what I am doing all the time when I have the hand piece in my hand. I am wondering if you had any advice for how you felt more,2021-2022,contact margin prep composite restoration bur remove
